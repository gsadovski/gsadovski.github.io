  abstract = {In this work, we propose a topological quantum field theory phase for four-dimensional gravity. We show it is able to generate, not only General Relativity, but the whole family of Lovelock-Cartan theories of gravity. This is accomplished due to the existence of a topological symmetry which, when explicitly broken via the introduction of a mass scale, releases the local degrees of freedom of gravity. Additionally, we introduce an extended notion of the (anti-)self-dual Landau gauge conditions to evaluate the Ward identities, counterterms, and prove the quantum stability of the model, to all orders in perturbation theory, using the algebraic renormalization technique.},

  abstract = { We investigate the scenarios in which a holonomic versus a non-holonomic frame description of gravity theories are equivalent. It turns out that classically, the equivalence holds in a way that is independent of the particular dynamics and/or spacetime dimension. This includes general metric-affine dynamics. A global bundle-theoretical investigation is carried out, uncovering the equivalence principle as the culprit. The equivalence holds as long as the equivalence principle holds. This is not something to be expected when non-invertible configurations of the vielbein field are taken into account. In such case, the gauge-theoretical description of gravity unsolders from spacetime, and one has to decide if gravity is spacetime geometry or an internal gauge theory. },

  abstract = { We study the Gribov problem in four-dimensional topological Yang-Mills theories following the Baulieu-Singer approach in the (anti-)self-dual Landau gauges. As suggested by the tree-level exactness of the model in this gauge choice, the Gribov copies are shown to be inoffensive at the quantum level. To be more precise, following Gribov, we discuss the path integral restriction to the Gribov horizon. The associated gap equation, which fixes the so-called Gribov parameter, is however shown to only possess a trivial solution, making the restriction obsolete. We relate this to the absence of radiative corrections in both gauge and ghost sectors. We give further evidence by employing the renormalization group which shows that, for this kind of topological model, the gap equation indeed forbids the introduction of a massive Gribov parameter. },

  abstract = { In 1989 E. Witten, using traditional QFT techniques, develop an exact path integral representation to many classes of topological invariants. These QFTs, so-called Topological QFTs (TQFTs), share the property that all of their observables are metric-independent. In other words, the observables are global invariants classifying the topological and smooth structure of spacetime. In this sense, one could say, that TQFTs are examples of background independent and exactly soluble perturbative QFTs. One of the most prominent example perhaps is the four dimensional Topological Yang-Mills theory (TYM). This theory can be obtained by the BRST quantization of the Pontryagin invariant {$\int tr(FF)$}, instead of the tradition Yang-Mills action {$ \int tr(F\star F)$}. The observables are known to be the Donaldson{'}s polynomials, which classify the smooth structure of the underlying manifold. In particular, TYM theory is so symmetric that it has remarkably simple quantum properties. For instance, in the Landau gauge, it renormalizes, to all orders in perturbation theory, with only one (nonphysical) parameter and the theory is actually exactly soluble at tree-level (all quantum corrections vanish). These remarkable properties led Witten to hypothesize if such a theory could describe an unbroken phase of General Relativity. In this thesis, we will propose a renormalizable TYM theory that can generate gravity via an explicity breaking of its topological BRST symmetry --- thus fulfilling Witten{'}s vision. In particular, we will consider the family of Lovelock-Cartan theories of gravity due to their generality and closer relation to the gauge structure. },

We extend the analysis of renormalizability for two generalized classes of gauges; each of them depending on one gauge parameter. The (anti-)self-dual Landau gauge is recovered at the vanishing of each gauge parameter. The theory shows itself to be renormalizable in these classes of gauges. Moreover, we discuss the ambiguity on the choice of the renormalization factors (which is not present in usual Yang-Mills theories) and argue a possible origin of such ambiguity. },

  abstract = { We show that the four-dimensional Lovelock-Cartan action can be derived from a massless gauge theory for the SO(1,3) group with an additional BRST trivial part. The model is originally composed by a topological sector and a BRST exact piece and has no explicit dependence on the metric, the vierbein or a mass parameter. The vierbein is introduced together with a mass parameter through some BRST trivial constraints. The effect of the constraints is to identify the vierbein with some of the additional fields, transforming the original action into the Lovelock-Cartan one. In this scenario, the mass parameter is identified with Newton{'}s constant while the gauge field is identified with the spin-connection. The symmetries of the model are also explored. Moreover, the extension of the model to a quantum version is qualitatively discussed. },

  abstract = { The main goal of the present work is to analyze the cosmological scenario of the induced gravity theory developed in previous works. Such a theory consists on a Yang-Mills theory in a four-dimensional Euclidian spacetime with {$SO(m,n)$} such that {$m+n=5$} and {$m\in \{0,1,2\}$} as its gauge group. This theory undergoes a dynamical gauge symmetry breaking via an Inonu-Wigner contraction in its infrared sector. As a consequence, the {$SO(m, n)$} algebra is deformed into a Lorentz algebra with the emergency of the local Lorentz symmetries and the gauge fields being identified with a vierbein and a spin connection. As a result, gravity is described as an effective Einstein-Cartan-like theory with ultraviolet correction terms and a propagating torsion field. We show that the cosmological model associated with this effective theory has three different regimes. In particular, the high curvature regime presents a de Sitter phase which tends towards a {$\Lambda$}CDM model. We argue that {$SO(m, n)$} induced gravities are promising effective theories to describe the early phase of the universe. },

  abstract = { Our main go in this thesis is to test the large-scale consistency of a quantum gravity model. This model consists of a Yang-Mills theory with gauge group {$SO(m,n)$} written in a four-dimensional Euclidean space-time. In the infrared limit, the {$SO(m,n)$} algebra undergoes an In{\"{o}}n{\"{u}}-Wigner contraction to Poincar{\'{e}} algebra and the gauge symmetry is broken. As consequence, Lorentz local symmetries arise and the gauge fields can be identified with a vierbein field, {$e(x)$}, and a spin connection field, {$\omega (x)$}. The resulting gravity is an effective Einstein-Cartan-like theory with ultraviolet correction terms and propagating torsion field. An advantage of this model is the natural appearance of a gravitational cosmological constant that, along with Newton{'}s gravitational constant, {$G$}, can be calculated perturbatively. Making use of the FLRW metric and the ansatz of a Riemannian spacetime we demonstrate that this effective gravity has the Standard Cosmological Model in its infrared sector. Furthermore, the ultraviolet regime foresee a hyper-accelerated de Sitter phase that may prove to be inflationary and also foresee the presence of exotic matter in the early universe. },
