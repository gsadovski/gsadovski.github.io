## Introduction

Amalie Emmy Noether is widely recognized as the most influential woman in the history of mathematics. Among her brilliant work, two theorems formulated in 1915 are known by every theoretical physicist. Noether's theorems impacted every branch of physics that involves the continuous evolution of a system. In mathematics, they constitute an important result in functional analysis, and have foundational role in algebraic topology, particularly the idea that algebraic structures can capture invariant properties of a space.

The theorems in question give a rigorous connection between the continuous symmetries of a dynamical system and its conservation laws. In classical and quantum field theory, they clarify how the presence of symmetries can constrain the dynamics, define charges, and even determine the physical states of a model.

The theorems work in both directions. Therefore, the presence of constrained dynamics and conserved charges also implies the existence of underlying symmetries. As one can imagine, this is an extremely powerful result, especially considering the fact that most of science involves predictions of how something was, will be, and what remains unchanged in the process.

## Prelude in classical field theory
To begin, let's consider $X$ an $n$-dimensional spacetime, and $\phi \left(x\right) \; ; \; x \in X$ a tensorial field over it with dynamics defined by the action functional

$$ S \left[ \phi \right] \equiv \int_{X} \mathcal{L} \left( \phi, d \phi \right)  \;, $$

where $d$ is the exterior derivative, and $\mathcal{L} \left( \phi, d \phi \right)$ is the $n$-form Lagrangian.

Under an infinitesimal field variation, $\phi \mapsto \phi' = \phi + \delta \phi$, which vanishes at the boundary $\partial X$ of $X$, the action functional will vary accordingly,

$$ \delta S \left[\phi\right] = \int_{X} {\delta}^{(1)}_{\phi} \mathcal{L} \delta\phi \;, $$

where $ {\delta}^{(1)}_{\phi} \equiv \frac{\partial }{\partial \phi} - d \left[ \frac{\partial }{\partial \left(d \phi\right)}\right] $ is the Euler-Lagrange operator.

Hamilton's principle ($\delta S = 0$) implies the Euler-Lagrange field equations $\delta^{(1)}_{\phi} \mathcal{L} = 0$, whose solutions are the extrema of $S$, and comprises the so-called "on-shell" configurations of the field $\phi$. These are the so-called classical solutions of the field $\phi$.

## What are symmetries?

Now, consider a $\alpha$-parameter family of infinitesimal variations, $ \phi \mapsto \phi' = \phi + \delta_{\xi ^{a}}\phi $ with $a \in \left\\{1, \cdots, \alpha\right\\} $, that do not necessarily vanish at $\partial_X$. This family of field transformations is said to be continuous, $C^k$-differentiable, smooth, *etc*, if the fields $\xi^{a} = \xi^a (x) \;$ are. If $\xi^a (x)$ are constants, the transformations are said to be global, otherwise they are local.  

We will assume that $\delta_{\xi^{a}}\phi$ satisfy the axioms of an algebra. This algebra will be finite-dimensional if the transformations are global, or infinite-dimensional if the transformations are local. Very important examples in high-energy physics are the BRST and the Lie algebras. Among these, only finite-dimensional Lie algebras are necessarily associated with the local properties of Lie groups. In fact, symmetries in physics are more often associated to algebras than to groups.

We say that $\xi^a$ are the elements of a quasi-symmetry algebra of a classical field theory if $ \delta_{\xi^{a}} S = \int_{\partial X} K_{\xi^{a}} $, where $K_{\xi^{a}}$ is a $(n-1)$-form depending arbitrarily on $\phi$ and $d \phi$. Clearly, quasi-symmetries are on-shell symmetries of a field theory since boundary terms do not contribute to the Euler-Lagrange field equations.

## The 1st Noether's theorem

The quasi-symmetry conditions above, when developed for the case of global transformations, lead to the so-called Noether's identities,

$$ \delta_{\phi}^{(1)} \mathcal{L} \delta_{\xi^{a}} \phi + d J_{\xi^{a}} = 0 \;, \tag{1}\label{eq:noethersidentities} $$

where 

$$ J_{\xi^{a}} \equiv \left[\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \left(d \phi\right)}\right] \delta_{\xi^{a}} \phi - K_{\xi^{a}} $$

are the so-called Noether's currents. These identities exemplify how the presence of (quasi-)symmetry generators, $\delta_{\xi^{a}} \phi$, constrain the Euler-Lagrange term, $\delta_{\phi}^{(1)}\mathcal{L}$, and *vice-versa*.

The 1st Noether's theorem is a particular case of the Noether's identity, restricted to on-shell field configurations. Explicitly, \eqref{eq:noethersidentities} reduces on-shell to a continuity equation, $d J_{\xi^{a}} = 0$. In other words, the presence of $\alpha$ global quasi-symmetry generators, $\delta_{\xi^{a}} \phi$, implies $\alpha$ on-shell conserved Noether's currents, $J_{\xi^{a}}$, and *vice-versa*. This is rigorously how symmetry algebra elements are connected to dynamical invariants.

Finally, for each $J_{\xi^{a}}$ we have a so-called conserved Noether's charge, $Q_{\xi^{a}} \equiv \int_{Y} J_{\xi^{a}}$, inside a spacelike $(n-1)$-submanifold $Y$ in $X$, and *vice-versa*.

## BRST symmetry algebra and charge

As mentioned, the BRST symmetry algebra is a important example present in gauge theories. Consider the Yang-Mills (YM) dynamics,

$$ S_{YM}[A] \equiv - \int_{X} \tr \left( F \star F \right) \;,  $$

where $- \tr$ is the Killing form on the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, $F=dA+A^2$ is the $\mathfrak{g}$-valued 2-form curvature (field strength) of the $\mathfrak{g}$-valued 1-form connection $A$ (gauge field); and, $\star$ is the Hodge operator on $X$.

The BRST algebra is a global symmetry of $S_{YM}[A]$. Explicitly, $\delta_{BRST} S_{YM} = 0$ such that $\delta_{BRST} A = -Dc$, and $\delta_{BRST} c = -c^2$, where $D = d + \left[A, \phantom{A}\right] $ is the exterior covariant derivative in the adjoint representation; and $c$ is the $\mathfrak{g}$-valued 0-form Faddeev-Popov ghost field introduced so that ${\delta_{BRST}}^2 = 0$. Noether's 1st theorem then implies that the YM dynamics is off-shell constrained, and on-shell there will be a conserved Noether's current, $J_{BRST} = \tr \left( \star FDc \right)$, and charge, $Q_{BRST} = \int_{Y} \tr \left( \star FDc\right)$.

In the absence of gauge anomalies, the BRST symmetry survives the quantization process[^1]. Noether's identities resurrect as the so-called Slavnov-Taylor identities constraining the quantum correlation functions, and guaranteeing that quantum YM theory is unitary and renormalizable to all orders in perturbation theory. Additionally, the Noether's charge $Q_{BRST}$ transforms into a nilpotent operator ${\hat{Q}_{BRST}}^2 = 0$, acting over the YM Fock space, $\mathcal{F}$. If not enough, its cohomology 

$$ H \left(\hat{Q}_{BRST}\right) \equiv \left\{ \hat{Q}_{BRST} \lvert \text{phys} \rangle = 0 \; ; \; \lvert \text{phys} \rangle \neq \hat{Q}_{BRST}\lvert \text{something} \rangle \right\} $$

isomorphically defines the subspace $ \mathcal{F}_{\text{phys}} \subset \mathcal{F} $ of physical states of the YM field.

[^1]: The quantization process involves adding to the YM action a gauge-fixing action, an external source action, *etc*, which will inevitably alter the form of $J_{BRST}= \tr \left( \star FDc \right)$ and $Q_{BRST} = \int_{X} \tr \left( \star FDc \right)$. This is to say that, even though these results are correct from a purely classical standpoint, they are plagued with gauge redundancies, and are not really the final forms that appear in a perturbative quantum field theory setting.
