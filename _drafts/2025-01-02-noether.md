## Introduction

Amalie Emmy Noether is widely recognized as the most influential woman in the history of mathematics. Among her brilliant work, two theorems formulated in 1915 are known by every theoretical physicist. Noether's theorems impacted every branch of physics that involves the continuous evolution of a system. In mathematics, they constitute an important result in functional analysis, and have foundational role in algebraic topology, particularly the idea that algebraic structures can capture invariant properties of a space.

The theorems in question give a rigorous connection between the continuous symmetries of a dynamical system and its conservation laws. In classical and quantum field theory, they clarify how the presence of symmetries can constrain the dynamics, define charges, and even establish the physical states of a model. The theorems work in the opposite direction too, the presence of a constrained dynamics and conserved charges imply the presence of underlying symmetries.

## Prelude in classical field theory
To begin, let's consider $X$ an $n$-dimensional spacetime, and $\phi \left(x\right) \; ; \; x \in X$ a tensorial field over it with dynamics defined by the action functional

$$ S \left[ \phi \right] \equiv \int_{X} \mathcal{L} \left( \phi, d \phi \right)  \;, $$

where $d$ is the exterior derivative, and $\mathcal{L} \left( \phi, d \phi \right)$ is the $n$-form Lagrangian.

Under an infinitesimal field variation, $\phi \mapsto \phi' = \phi + \delta \phi$, which vanishes at the boundary $\partial X$ of $X$, the action functional will vary accordingly,

$$ \delta S \left[\phi\right] = \int_{X} {\delta}^{(1)}_{\phi} \mathcal{L} \delta\phi \;, $$

where $ {\delta}^{(1)}_{\phi} \equiv \frac{\partial }{\partial \phi} - d \left[ \frac{\partial }{\partial \left(d \phi\right)}\right] $ is the Euler-Lagrange operator.

Hamilton's principle ($\delta S = 0$) implies the Euler-Lagrange field equations $\delta^{(1)}_{\phi} \mathcal{L} = 0$, whose solutions are the extrema of $S$, and comprises the so-called "on-shell" configurations of the field $\phi$. These are the so-called classical solutions of the field $\phi$.

## What are symmetries?

Now, consider a $\alpha$-parameter family of infinitesimal variations, $ \phi \mapsto \phi' = \phi + \delta_{\xi ^{a}}\phi $ with $a \in \left\\{1, \cdots, \alpha\right\\} $, that do not necessarily vanish at $\partial_X$. This family of field transformations is said to be continuous, $C^k$-differentiable, smooth, *etc*, if the fields $\xi^{a} = \xi^a (x) \;$ are. If $\xi^a (x)$ are constants, the transformations are said to be global, otherwise they are local.  

We will assume that $\delta_{\xi^{a}}\phi$ satisfy the axioms of an algebra. This algebra will be finite-dimensional if the transformations are global, or infinite-dimensional if the transformations are local. Very important examples in high-energy physics are the BRST and the Lie algebras. Among these, only finite-dimensional Lie algebras are necessarily associated with the local properties of Lie groups. In fact, symmetries in physics are more often associated to algebras than to groups.

We say that $\xi^a$ are the elements of a quasi-symmetry algebra of a classical field theory if $ \delta_{\xi^{a}} S = \int_{\partial X} K_{\xi^{a}} $, where $K_{\xi^{a}}$ is a $(n-1)$-form depending arbitrarily on $\phi$ and $d \phi$. Clearly, quasi-symmetries are on-shell symmetries of a field theory since boundary terms do not contribute to Euler-Lagrange field equations.
