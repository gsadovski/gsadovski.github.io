## Introduction

Amalie Emmy Noether is widely recognized as the most influential woman in the history of mathematics. Among her brilliant work, two theorems formulated in 1915 are known by every theoretical physicist. Noether's theorems are one of the most important results in physics. It impacted mathematics in fields such as functional analysis and algebraic topology. In particular, the idea that algebraic structures can, at times, capture invariant properties of a space.

The theorems give a mathematically rigorous connection between continuous symmetries of a dynamical system and its conservation laws. In classical and quantum field theory, they clarify how the presence of symmetries can constrain the dynamics, define charges, and even establish the physical states of a model, and *vice-versa*.

To begin, let's consider $X$ an $n$-dimensional spacetime, and $\phi \left(x\right) \; ; \; x \in X$ a tensorial field over it with dynamics defined by the action functional

$$ S \left[ \phi \right] \equiv \int_{X} \mathcal{L} \left( \phi, d \phi \right) \;, $$

where $d$ is the exterior derivative, and $\mathcal{L} \left( \phi, d \phi \right)$ is the $n$-form Lagrangian.

Under an infinitesimal field variation, $\phi \mapsto \phi' = \phi + \delta \phi$, which vanishes at the boundary $\partial X$ of $X$, the action functional will vary accordingly,

$$ \delta S \left[\phi\right] = \int_{X} {\delta}^{(1)}_{\phi} \mathcal{L} \delta\phi \;, $$

where $ {\delta}^{(1)}_{\phi} \equiv \frac{\partial }{\partial \phi} - d \left[ \frac{\partial }{\partial \left(d \phi\right)}\right] $ is the Euler-Lagrange operator.

Hamilton's principle ($\delta S = 0$) implies the Euler-Lagrange field equations $\delta^{(1)}_{\phi} \mathcal{L} = 0$, whose solutions are the extrema of $S$, and comprises the so-called "on-shell" configurations of the field $\phi$.
