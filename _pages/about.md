I am a theoretical physicist with a passion for high-energy physics and gravity in extreme regimes. My research delves into the most fundamental aspects of the universe, particularly the quantum nature of the gravitational field. I hold a PhD, specializing in the interplay between topological and gravitational field theories.

Aside from my academic pursuits, I'm an avid traveler, having lived in 5 different countries and visited 20 more. Each of these places profoundly shaped my perspective, enriching my understanding of different cultures and the world around me. But mostly, I've learned that life is always better next to the ocean.

I am a passionate SCUBA and freediver with over 300 logged dives. I find that nothing compares to the joy of being underwater with a limited gas supply. Jokes aside, it's a unique activity that challenges you mentally and physically. I also have an appreciation for simple pleasures, such as a good cup of coffee in the morning or a cold beer on a warm summer day.

Online, I am a GNU/Linux enthusiast. My preferred flavor is Arch Linux for its flexibility and control. I orbit around TUI applications due to the efficiency and simplicity they provide. In practice, though, GUI is an unavailable fact of life.
