## Introduction

Einstein's equations in vacuum, $R_{\mu \nu} = 0$, consists of ten coupled non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs) for the Lorentzian 4-metric $g_{\mu \nu}(x)$. Given the complexity of these dynamical equations, it is not immediately clear that General Relativity (GR) is a deterministic theory. 

Determinism is a important feature of physical theories. In a deterministic description, the whole past and future of a system can be determined, with infinite precision, from a very minimal set of initial data. This makes deterministic theories extremely predictive and appealing to the scientific framework.

Mathematically, determinism is reflected by a system of differential equations whose solutions exist, and can be uniquely determined by a set of initial data. Examples of theories with this well-defined Cauchy problem are: Newton's 2nd law of classical mechanism, described by a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs); Maxwell's equations for the electromagnetic field, described by a set of linear PDEs; even Schr√∂dinger's equation for the unitary evolution of a quantum state in the absence of measurements (collapses of the wave functions), given by a single linear ODE; and the list goes on.
 
A detailed study of the predictive power of GR needs to address the proof of existence and uniqueness of its solutions. Of course, a natural step is to attempt to formulation of a well-defined Cauchy problem for Einstein's equations. However, this has proven to be difficult. And, even if we're eventually successful, our results would still be restricted to the subspace of foliatable solutions only.

An important tool in this endevor is the use of the harmonic gauge condition. In this gauge, Einstein's equations assume the form of quasi-linear hyperbolic PDEs (wave equations). The Cauchy-Kowalesvski (CK) theorem then applies, and we can at least guarantee the *local* existence and uniqueness.

On the other hand, the *global* proof of existence and uniqueness of solutions is still an open problem. The theorems of existence of spacetime singularities, and the possible existence of Cauchy horizons, are especially crippling in this regard. The weak and strong cosmic censorship conjecture were formulated in an attempt to mitigate this situation by restoring GR's determinism for asymptotic observers. Nevertheless, very recently, evidence against these censorship conjectures started piling up.

One now has to wonder how predictive GR really is?

## The harmonic gauge

GR has dynamics invariant under the group of diffeomorphism maps among Lorentzian 4-manifolds. This means that its physical solutions are equivalence classes under these maps. Each class, or each physical solution, has many (actually an infinite number) equivalent representatives. This enormous redundancy implies that Einstein's equations are plagued with pure gauge artifacts, making them more complex than necessary to describe the physical degrees of freedom of the gravitational field.

To gauge fix the invariance under diffeomorphisms gives us a way to simplify Einstein's equations without really sacrificing its physical content. A convenient choice is the so-called harmonic gauge fix condition, defined by the constraint equations, $\Box x^{\mu} = 0$, where $\Box \equiv g^{\mu \nu} \nabla_{\mu} \nabla_{\nu}$ is the d'Alembertian operator in a curved spacetime. Applying this condition to Einstein's equations in vacuum, $R_{\mu \nu} = 0$, shapes them into the form $\Box g_{\mu \nu} = N_{\mu \nu}$, where $N_{\mu \nu}$ are non-linear terms up to the 1st derivative of $g_{\mu \nu}$.

The wave-like equations $\Box g_{\mu \nu} = N_{\mu \nu}$ are mathematically classified as a set of quasi-linear hyperbolic PDEs. Luckily, this branch of Analysis is particularly more well-developed than the branch of fully non-linear generic PDEs. For instance, the local existence and uniqueness of their solutions are proven in a result known as the Cauchy-Kowalevski theorem.

In summary, the harmonic gauge is important because it allows us to prove that, at the very least, GR is a deterministic theory in a small enough neighborhood of its solution space.

## The ADM formalism

Let's consider $\left(X, g_{\mu \nu}\right)$ a Lorentzian 4-manifold. If foliatable, there exists a diffeomorphism map $f: X \mapsto \mathbb{R}\times\Sigma$, check Figure 1. This allows to define in $X$ a 1-parameter family of spacelike 3-manifolds, $\Sigma_{\lambda} \equiv f^{-1} \left( \left\\{\lambda \right\\} \times \Sigma \right) \; ; \; \lambda \in \mathbb{R} $, which are called the "leaves" in this foliation of $X$. Each leaf $\Sigma_{\lambda}$ has an induced 3-metric, $h_{ij} \left(\lambda\right)$, and an extrinsic curvature, $K_{ij} \left(\lambda\right)$. Furthermore, there also exists a globally well-defined, smooth, timelike vector field, $\partial_{\lambda}$, that generates a global flow of time.

Foliability implies something which is very mundane for us: that space and time are separated, orthogonal, entities. We measure space with a ruler, time with a clock. Ever a situation arose in which we needed both a rule and a clock to measure space, or a ruler and a clock to measure time. And, to be frank, this is always true as long as we are measuring a small enough neighborhood of spacetime (most of us never even left Earth anyway). However, in theory, this cannot be guaranteed over the entire spacetime (globally) for whatever solution of GR. This is a feature (not a bug) of its full invariance under diffeomorphism maps. Hence, if we want to establish a global notion of time evolution, initial data, *etc*. (necessary for a well-defined Cauchy problem), we need to assume foliability and make use of a foliation.

The Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) formalism makes use of a foliation to split Einstein's equations apart. Mind that there are many (*a.k.a.* infinite) ways to split Einstein's equations apart, but the ADM one is remarkable because the result of projecting Einstein's equations onto the leaves, separates them in constraint *versus* dynamical equations. Concurrently, it establishes the trio $\left( \Sigma_{\lambda}, h_{ij}, K_{ij}\right)$ as their Cauchy data.
