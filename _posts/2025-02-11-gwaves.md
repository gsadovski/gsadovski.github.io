## Introduction

Gravitational waves (g-waves) are propagating modes of the gravitational field, and an old prediction from general relativity (GR) made by A. Einstein himself. In particular, they are tensorial, massless, and excited only by energy-momentum distributions with non-vanishing 2nd order time derivative of their quadrupole moment (bare with me).

G-waves in GR are the analog of the electromagnetic radiation in Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism. And, just like light, carry important information about their source. They are irreplaceable when all other channels of radiation (electromagnetic, neutrinos, cosmic rays, etc.) are blocked. For instance, when two black holes coalesce (a BH-BH merger).

This is why g-waves were such a big news a few years back. The first ever detection happened in 2015, when the interferometry observatories LIGO and VIRGO simultaneously observed the same BH-BH merger, 1.3 billion light-years away from Earth {% cite ligo2016a %}. This event, named [GW150914][wiki/GW150914], was completely invisible to us otherwise (see Video 1). Thus, its detection represented the birth of a completely new era in astronomy, similar to the first use of the telescope to observe the night sky, done by Galileo Galilei in 1609.

G-waves can also be used in addition to other channels, when they are unblocked. This is known as *multichannel* or *multi-messenger astronomy*, and has the potential to revolutionize astrophysics. For example, our understanding of coalescing neutron stars (NS-NS mergers). Such events emit weaker signals, as they consist of much smaller masses. So, it took longer to detect. But, in 2017, it finally happened. [GW170817][wiki/GW170817] was the first (and, so far, the only) NS-NS merger observed via g-waves {% cite ligo2017a %}.

Approximately 1.7s after GW170817, its electromagnetic counterpart arrived in the form of a [short gamma-ray burst][wiki/grb], detected by the Fermi and INTEGRAL space telescopes. Finally, approximately 11hs later, the optical part revealed itself as a [kilonova][wiki/kilonova], ~140 million light-years away in the lenticular galaxy NGC4994, located at the Hydra constellation (check Video 2). The kilonova was observed by traditional telescopes all around Earth, and lasted a few weeks shinning across all the electromagnetic spectrum --- from X-rays to visible light to infrared.

GW150914 and GW170817 are two of the most impactful events in the 21st century physics. The [2016 Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics][web/2016-special-breakthrough-prize], the [2016 Gruber Prize in Cosmology][web/2016-gruber-prize], the [2017 Breakthrough Of The Year][web/2017-breakthrough-of-the-year], and the [2017 Nobel Prize in Physics][web/2017-nobel-prize-in-physics] were all dedicated to them.

## What are gravitational waves? 

Just like one recognizes small ripples propagating across a lake as water waves (Figure 1), one could recognize small ripples rolling across the fabric of spacetime as g-waves. This is, of course, quite an idealized scenario, but which helps us understand and easily visualize wave phenomena. In reality, we know most waves are quite messy and difficult to precisely describe.

To illustrate, it is enough to consider a windy day. The surface of the lake might become so choppy it might be hard to distinguish ripples from their surroundings (Figure 2). The lack of clear separation might force you to point to the whole lake as a single wavy mess. And to describe it mathematically, in a nice closed form, might be extremely hard, if not impossible.

The same can happen to spacetime, *e.g.*, in the vicinity of a BH-BH merger. In fact, GW150914 produced so much energy in the form of g-waves, one would have to imagine a wind turbine so powerful, it would outshine the light production of all the stars in the entire observable universe. This was the level of chaos unleashed. Video 3 illustrate how choppy spacetime got in the vicinity of GW150914. Pay attention to the last 20 milliseconds, this is when the g-wave production peaked, and the power output outshone the observable universe 50 times over!

G-waves can very easily produce a messy environment due to their natural non-linear behavior. They are dynamically described by Einstein's field equations, which consist of 10 non-linear partial differential equations (nPDEs). In vacuum, they read $R_{\mu \nu} = 0$, and look deceptively simple. However, they imply g-waves are described by the curvature of spacetime, and also that g-waves produce and interact with the curvature of spacetime. This is known as *backreaction*, and has important net effects: g-waves can refract, redshift, backscatter, damp, *etc*, all in vacuum.

For comparison, electromagnetic waves are much more well-behaved. Dynamically, they are described by Maxwell's equations which are linear PDEs. In some sense, they are still curvature, but linearity means that it does not interact with itself. Thus, to be messy, light really needs to interact with matter or with gravity. Only then it refracts, redshifts, backscatters, damps, *etc*.

In addition to the messiness of g-waves, a particularly energetic one can, in principle, undergo gravitational collapse. If focused on a small enough region, it can produce a black hole which destroys a portion of spacetime (geodesic incompleteness). We can hardly call this g-wave a ripple. A catastrophic megatsunami might be more fitting.

It should be clear real g-wave phenomena are extremely complex. In fact, when serious astrophysicists want to realistically simulate g-wave production, they have no choice but to numerically solve the full set of nPDEs in a supercomputer. Unfortunately, I am not a serious astrophysicist. The g-waves we're going to discuss next can be written down in terms of elementary functions like $\sin(x)$, $\cos(x)$, $e^x$, *etc*. Mathematically, they are very nice. However, we know now that "nice mathematics" cannot cope with the richness of g-waves. In other words, these solutions don't really exist in nature --- they are too idealized. Nevertheless, they still carry some qualitative features shared with real g-waves. So, I hope you can still find them interesting and illuminating.

## PP-wave spacetimes

We start with idealized but exact g-wave solutions. Due to how this subject is taught in undergrad courses all around the world, there is a misconception, even among physicists, that we first need to linearize $ R_{\mu \nu} = 0 $ in order to get mathematically nice solutions. In other words, we need to throw away the non-linearities of gravity, making it look more similar to electromagnetism. This is, however, not true. There is a whole class of exact g-waves solutions known as *plane-fronted waves with parallel propagation* (pp-waves). Admittedly, they are not as easy to intuitively visualize as linear solutions are.

First, consider spacetime to be a Lorentzian 4-manifold $\left(X,g\right)$, where $g(x)$ is known as *the metric tensor field*. The latter gives us a recipe on how to measure angles and sizes at each event $x \in X$ of spacetime. For that, we generally need 10 variables, $ g_{\nu \mu} = g_{\mu \nu} \equiv g \left(\partial_{\mu}, \partial_{\nu}\right)$, known as the components of $g(x)$ as observed by $\partial_{\mu}$. This is important. Field $g(x)$ is what comes out as solutions to Einstein's field equations. In other words, it is the fundamental descriptor of gravity.

The family of pp-wave spacetimes consists of all $\left(X, g\right)$ which admits a covariantly constant null vector field $k$. This means $k$ needs to satisfy $g_{\mu \nu}k^{\mu}k^{\nu} = 0$ and $\nabla_{\mu} k^{\nu} = 0$. The physics savvy reader might be already suspicious that $k$ is the well-known wave vector --- you're right! Notice as well that this definition is independent of physics, it exclusively involved mathematical conditions belonging to the realm of Lorentzian geometry. In fact, they have their own mathematical relevance as Petrov type N manifolds.

Pp-wave spacetimes locally admit the Brinkmann coordinate patch, defined as $\left(u, v, x, y\right) \; ; \; u \in \left(u_0,u_1\right),\; v,x,y \in \left(-\infty, +\infty\right) $, where $k= \partial_{v}$. On it, the metric tensor assumes the form

$$ g(x) = H \left(u,x,y\right) du^2 + 2 dudv + dx^2 + dy^2 \;,  $$ 

where $H \left(u, x, y\right)$ is analytic in $x,y$, but otherwise arbitrary.

Finally, physics kicks in when we demand $g(x)$ to be a solution of $R_{\mu \nu} = 0$. One can show this is equivalent to demand $H$ to be harmonic in $xy$. Explicitly, $\Box H (u_0, x, y)= 0$, where $u_0$ is a constant. No surprise, Einstein's equations demand $H$ to oscillate (like a wave) in the $xy$ direction. In fact, surfaces of constant $(v_0,u_0)$ can be interpreted as propagating wavefronts.

Clearly, $H$ encodes the particular details of each solution. For instance, if $H = 0$ the metric is just flat Minkowski. If $H$ has compact support the solution can be interpreted as g-wave packet (a pulse). If $H$ is quadratic in $xy$, the wavefronts have plane geometry (plane g-waves). And so forth.

## Linear g-waves

Exact solutions aside, let's address the more pedagogical approach usually taught in undergrad courses. First, we establish the simplest solution to Einstein's equations in vacuum. This is the globally flat Minkowski spacetime, denoted by $\left(X,\eta\right)$ where 

$$ \eta \left(x\right) = -dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 \;, $$ 

and $t,x,y,z \in \left(-\infty, +\infty\right)$ is the globally defined Cartezian patch. Because Minkowski is everywhere flat, it is also destitute of any gravitational fields. One could say it is the *lowest energy*, most boring solution of $R_{\mu \nu} = 0$. Thus, it is the perfect background to study how ripples propagate.

Our objective here is to describe a situation very similar to Figure 1, where the solution is very easy to visualize due to a clear separation between ripples and surrounding background. In other words, we want to find a solution equivalent to "$\eta$ plus ripples". Mathematically, we propose $g' = f^{\ast} g \; ; \; g' \equiv \eta + h$, where $f: \left(X,g'\right) \rightarrow \left(X,g\right)$ is a diffeomorphism. To be clear, $h$ is a symmetric rank-2 tensor field supposed to describe the ripples.

If $g$ is a solution, $g'$ has to be as well. This is because Einstein's field equations are covariant under diffeomorphisms. Saying it differently, $g$ and $g'$ equivalently describe the same physical scenario: Minkowski with ripples. Therefore, $R_{\mu \nu} \left(g', \partial g', \partial^{2} g'\right) = 0$. Moreover, $\eta$ is also a solution --- in fact, we already establish it as the globally constant most boring one, $\partial \eta = \partial^2 \eta = 0$. Then, what we actually have is

$$R_{\mu \nu} \left(\eta, h, \partial h, \partial^2 h\right) = 0 \;. \label{eq:einstein-eq-for-h} \tag{1}$$

We clearly achieved separation since Einstein's equations became differential only for $h$. One could say we're dealing now with a traditional field theory over a fixed Minkowski background. Nonetheless, \eqref{eq:einstein-eq-for-h} is still nonlinear, which means solutions can still be very messy. Our next step is to throw away these non-linearities, making it very similar to the electromagnetic theory.

### Perturbation theory 

The messiness brought by non-linearities can also manifest in the real world as caustics, shockwaves, phase transitions, turbulence, singularities, *etc*. Thus, it is nothing but reasonable to expect $h$ to be, at the very most, a $C^{\infty}$ (smooth) field. In fact, \eqref{eq:einstein-eq-for-h} only demands it to be $C^2$ (twice differentiable). Figure 2, again, represents quite an extreme example (but not at all uncommon) in which smoothness is definitely absent, and $C^0$ (continuity) is questionable.

We can throw all of this physical richness away by demanding $h$ to be $C^\omega$ (analytic). This is quite a restrictive assumption, and only represents a very tiny bit of the space of all solutions of \eqref{eq:einstein-eq-for-h}. In fact, it is so restrictive it forbids $h$ to be compactly supported due to Paley-Wiener theorem. In other words, $C^\omega$ solutions are incapable of describing how g-waves are dynamically generated because they are all necessarily eternal and omnipresent. Indeed, the $C^{\omega}$ subspace of solutions is quite unphysical.

On the other hand, analyticity might be a physical sacrifice worth paying for, at times. Pedagogically, for instance, $C^\omega$ solutions are much simpler to understand and visualize. Computationally, they are much easier to obtain. And, physically, they might still share some qualitative features with their $C^{\infty}$ counterparts.

So, let's move on. If you have studied calculus, you probably remember that an analytic function is a function that can be locally determined in terms of a convergent power series. If $h$ were to be analytic, then 

$$ h = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} h^{(n)} \;. \label{eq:formal-power-series} \tag{2}$$ 

If $h$ were not to be analytic, then the right-hand side (RHS) of \eqref{eq:formal-power-series} would be what mathematicians call a [formal power series][wiki/formal-power-series]. An infinite sum which has no obligation to converge to a finite value, much less one equal to $h$. In such cases, this "equation" would indeed be mathematical wizardry.

Either way, physicists like to call this technique *perturbation theory*. And its goal is not necessarily to compute the whole infinite sum above, but only a finite piece of it. The higher the $n$, the bigger the piece. The bigger the piece, the closer it approximates the exact solution $h$. Or, at least, that is what we would like to think. Again, in reality, this is only true if, and only if, $h$ is $C^{\omega}$. In particular, analyticity also means $n=1$ is dominant, and $n>1$ represent increasingly small corrections. Otherwise the series would not converge to a finite result.

<!--Due to their level of mathematical sketchiness, perturbative solutions only have value if compared and contrasted to more rigorous ones, coming from more trustworthy methods.-->

<!--For instance, the next section only exists because what we find there is qualitatively consistent with properties of numerical solutions obtained directly from \eqref{eq:einstein-eq-for-h}. So, it should be clear that perturbation theory is just a sort of mathematical shortcut. In particular, g-waves do not depend, in any shape or form, on its use. In fact, they don't even depend on the use of numerics. The full exact set of 10 nPDEs describing $g$ can be put in the form of quasi-linear wave equations without any extra set of conditions but the [harmonic gauge][wiki/harmonic-gauge] ones, $g^{\mu\nu} \Gamma_{\mu\nu}^{\lambda} = 0$, where $ \Gamma_{\mu\nu}^{\lambda} $ are the Christoffel symbols.-->

### Plane waves 

Now we put all the caveats of the previous section aside, and unreservedly substitute \eqref{eq:formal-power-series} in \eqref{eq:einstein-eq-for-h}. The $n=0$ order in a power series is just a constant. Minkowski plus a constant is diffeomorphically Minkowski again. Thus, at this order, the substitution just trivially results in the statement that Minkowski is globally flat --- something we already knew. Now, at $n=1$ order, the substituting now reads

$$ \Box h^{(1)}_{\mu \nu} = 0 \;, \label{eq:g-wave-eq} \tag{3}$$ 

where $ h_{\mu \nu} \equiv h (\partial_{\mu}, \partial_{\nu}) $, and $\Box \equiv \eta^{\mu\nu} \partial_\mu \partial_\nu$ is the d'Alembertian differential operator. This is something new. In fact, the equations in \eqref{eq:g-wave-eq} are the classic linear wave equations!

These are contradictory premises because only analytic functions equal power series. Thus, the equal sign in \eqref{eq:formal-power-series} is really sketchy from a mathematical standpoint.

$$ \Box h^{(n)}_{\mu \nu} = N^{(n)}_{\mu \nu} \;, $$ 

where $N^{(n)}_{\mu \nu}$ is a non-linear function depending on $h^{(n-1)}_{\mu \nu}$.


at the same time that It has no obligation to equal a power series, which is a property of analytic objects. The right hand side of \eqref{eq:formal-power-series} is what mathematicians call a [formal power series][wiki/formal-power-series]. It is sum of a infinite number of term which has no obligation to converge to a finite value. Thus, the equality in \eqref{eq:formal-power-series} is the really sketchy part.
[wiki/formal-power-series]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_power_series

We're advancing, but at this point we still don't know much about $h$ because Einstein's equations in \eqref{eq:einstein-eq-for-h} are still too hard to solve. What we can qualitatively infer is that, in realistic physical scenarios, $h$ is at most smooth. This fact makes the next step a little bit sketchy from a mathematical standpoint. To be able to solve \eqref{eq:einstein-eq-for-h} without the aid of a supercomputer, we'll have to assume that $h$ can be expanded in a power series, 

%$$ h = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} h^{(n)} \;, \label{eq:formal-power-series} \tag{2}$$
