## Introduction

Gravitational waves (g-waves) are propagating modes of the gravitational field, and an old prediction from general relativity (GR) made by A. Einstein himself. In particular, they are tensorial, massless, and excited only by energy-momentum distributions with non-vanishing 2nd order time derivative of their quadrupole moment (bare with me).

G-waves in GR are the analog of the electromagnetic radiation in Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism. And, just like light, carry important information about their source. They are irreplaceable when all other channels of radiation (electromagnetic, neutrinos, cosmic rays, etc.) are blocked. For instance, when two black holes coalesce (a BH-BH merger).

This is why g-waves were such a big news a few years back. The first ever detection happened in 2015, when the interferometry observatories LIGO and VIRGO simultaneously observed the same BH-BH merger, 1.3 billion light-years away from Earth {% cite ligo2016a %}. This event, named [GW150914][wiki/GW150914], was completely invisible to us otherwise (see Video 1). Thus, its detection represented the birth of a completely new era in astronomy, similar to the first use of the telescope to observe the night sky, done by Galileo Galilei in 1609.

G-waves can also be used in addition to other channels, when they are unblocked. This is known as *multichannel* or *multi-messenger astronomy*, and it is particularly important when two neutron stars coalesce (a NS-NS merger). Such an event emits a weaker signal, as it consists of much smaller masses. So, it took longer to detect. But, in 2017, it finally happened. [GW170817][wiki/GW170817] was the first (and, so far, the only) NS-NS merger observed via g-waves {% cite ligo2017a %}.

Approximately 1.7s later, GW170817's electromagnetic counterpart arrived in the form of a [short gamma-ray burst][wiki/grb], detected by the Fermi and INTEGRAL space telescopes. Finally, approximately 11hs later, the optical part revealed itself as a [kilonova][wiki/kilonova], ~140 million light-years away in the lenticular galaxy NGC4994, located at the Hydra constellation (check Video 2).

The kilonova was observed by traditional telescopes all around Earth, and lasted a few weeks shinning across all the bands in electromagnetic spectrum --- from X-rays to visible light to infrared waves.

GW150914 and GW170817 are two of the most impactful events in the 21st century Physics. The [2016 Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics][web/2016-special-breakthrough-prize], the [2016 Gruber Prize in Cosmology][web/2016-gruber-prize], the [2017 Breakthrough Of The Year][web/2017-breakthrough-of-the-year], and the [2017 Nobel Prize in Physics][web/2017-nobel-prize-in-physics] were all dedicated to them.

## What are gravitational waves? 

Just like one recognizes small ripples propagating across a lake as water waves (Figure 1), one could recognize small ripples rolling across the fabric of spacetime as g-waves. This is, of course, quite an idealized scenario, but which helps us understand and easily visualize wave phenomena. In reality, we know most waves are quite messy and difficult to precisely describe.

To illustrate, it is enough to consider a windy day. The surface of the lake might become so choppy it might be hard to distinguish ripples from their surroundings (Figure 2). The lack of clear separation might force you to point to the whole lake as a single wavy mess. And to describe it mathematically, in a nice closed form, might be extremely hard, if not impossible.

The same can happen to spacetime, *e.g.*, in the vicinity of a BH-BH merger. In fact, GW150914 produced so much energy in the form of g-waves, one would have to imagine a wind turbine so powerful, it would outshine the light production of all the stars in the entire observable universe. This was the level of chaos unleashed. Video 3 illustrate how choppy spacetime got in the vicinity of GW150914. Pay attention to the last 20 milliseconds, this is when the g-wave production peaked, and the power output outshone the observable universe not once, but 50 times over!

G-waves can very easily produce a messy environment due to their natural non-linear behavior. They are dynamically described by Einstein's field equations, which consist of 10 non-linear partial differential equations (nPDEs). In vacuum, they read $R_{\mu \nu} = 0$, and look deceptively simple. However, they imply g-waves are described by the curvature of spacetime, and also that g-waves produce and interact with the curvature of spacetime. This is known as *backreaction*, and has important net effects: g-waves can refract, redshift, backscatter, damp, *etc*, all in vacuum.

For comparison, electromagnetic waves are much more well-behaved. Dynamically, they are described by Maxwell's equations which are linear PDEs. In some sense, they are still curvature, but linearity means that it does not interact with itself. Thus, to be messy, light really needs to interact with matter or with gravity. Only then it refracts, redshifts, backscatters, damps, *etc*.

In addition to the messiness, an energetic g-wave can, in principle, undergo gravitational collapse. If focused on a small enough region, it can produce a black hole which destroys a portion of spacetime (geodesic incompleteness). We can hardly call this g-wave a ripple. A catastrophic megatsunami might be more fitting.

It should be clear by now that real g-wave phenomena is extremely complex. In fact, when serious astrophysicists want to realistically simulate their production, they have no choice but to numerically solve the full set of Einstein's field equations in a supercomputer. Unfortunately, I am not a serious astrophysicist.

The g-waves we're going to discuss next can be written down in terms of elementary functions like $\sin(x)$, $\cos(x)$, $e^x$, *etc*. Mathematically, they are very nice. However, we now know that "nice mathematics" just cannot cope with the complexities exhibited by real g-waves. So, these solutions don't really exist in nature. Nonetheless, I hope you can still find them illuminating.

## PP-wave spacetimes

Let's begin dispelling the myth that $R_{\mu \nu} = 0$ need to be linearized. There is a whole class of exact g-wave solutions for them known as *plane-fronted waves with parallel propagation* (pp-waves).

Consider spacetime to be Lorentzian 4-manifold $\left(X,g_{\mu \nu}\right)$, where $g_{\mu \nu}$ are 10 variables which describe how to angles and sizes are measured. We call them (the components of) a *metric tensor field*. These are the variables that come out as solutions to Einstein's field equations.

The family of pp-wave spacetimes consists of all $\left(X, g_{\mu \nu}\right)$, solutions to $R_{\mu \nu} = 0$, which admits a covariantly constant null vector field $k$. This means $k$ needs to satisfy $g_{\mu \nu}k^{\mu}k^{\nu} = 0$ and $\nabla_{\mu} k^{\nu} = 0$.


## Linear g-waves

The simplest solution to Einstein's equations in vacuum is the globally flat Minkowski spacetime, denoted $\left(X,\eta\right)$ where $\eta_{\mu \nu} = \mathrm{diag}\left(-1,+1,+1,+1\right) \; ; \; \eta_{\mu \nu} \equiv \eta \left(\partial_{\mu}, \partial_{\nu}\right)$. Because it is everywhere flat, it is also destitute of any gravitational fields. One could say it is the *lowest energy*, most boring solution to Einstein's vacuum equations. Thus, it is the perfect background to study how ripples propagate.

Second, we want to find a solution $g$ to Einstein's equations which is equivalent to $\eta$ plus ripples. Mathematically, we propose $g' = f^{\ast} g \; ; \; g' \equiv \eta + h$, where $f: \left(X,g'\right) \rightarrow \left(X,g\right)$ is a diffeomorphism. To be clear, $h$ is a symmetric rank-2 tensor field supposed to be describing the ripples. If $g$ is a solution, $g'$ has to be as well. This is because they're both equivalently describing the same physical situation: Minkowski with ripples. Therefore, $R_{\mu \nu} \left(g', \partial g', \partial^{2} g'\right) = 0$. Additionally, we've already discussed that $\eta$ is a solution. In fact, a globally constant most boring one, $\partial \eta = \partial^2 \eta = 0$. Then, what we actually have is

$$R_{\mu \nu} \left(\eta, h, \partial h, \partial^2 h\right) = 0 \;. \label{eq:einstein-eq-for-h} \tag{1}$$

Einstein's equations became a set of 10 nPDEs for $h$ alone, the ripples of spacetime. In fact, we can say that the space of solutions of \eqref{eq:einstein-eq-for-h} is the set of all g-waves in Minkowski spacetime. But that is not particularly illuminating for us because these equations are still too hard to solve without the aid of a supercomputer --- by the way, this is exactly what serious astrophysicists do when running numerical simulations of BH-BH mergers. But since we are not serious astrophysicists, we can only infer a few qualitative properties from them. For instance, that $h$ is at least $C^2$ and, at most, $C^\infty$ differentiable in most physically reasonable scenarios.

## Perturbation theory 

The ego of a theoretical physicist is always hurt when they are told they need a computer to solve something. In these desperate situations, our beloved mathematical rigor is sacrificed on behalf of a (our) greater good.

To force beautiful solutions out of \eqref{eq:einstein-eq-for-h}, we pretend $h$ is $C^\omega$ (analytic) even though it is at most $C^\infty$ (smooth). The price paid is not only lack of rigor, but these solutions turn out to be quite unrealistic. In fact, they do not exist in Nature. However, as we will see, it is a price worth paying for. Not only to save-guard our self-esteem, but also they keep a lot of qualitative features in common with real g-waves. And, as a bonus, they are also much simpler to understand.

So, an analytic function is a function that can be locally given in terms of a convergent power series. If $h$ were to be analytic, then 

$$ h = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} h^{(n)} \;. \label{eq:formal-power-series} \tag{2}$$ 

Since it is not, then the equal sign above is really sketchy indeed. If not enough, the right-hand side (RHS) of this "equation" is what mathematicians call a [formal power series][wiki/formal-power-series]. In particular, this infinite sum has no obligation to converge to a finite value, much less one equal to $h$.

Physicists like to call this technique *perturbation theory*. Its goal is not really to make sense of the whole infinite sum above, but only a finite piece of it. The higher the $n$, the bigger the piece. The bigger the piece, the more complicated are the equations. The more complicated the equations, the more realistic are the solutions. Or, at least, that is what we would like to think. Even if we managed to find a radius of convergence for the whole sum, again, that wouldn't make it necessarily equal to $h$ --- otherwise $h$ would be analytic! 

We stress that perturbative solutions only have value if compared and contrasted to more rigorous ones, coming from more trustworthy methods. For instance, the next section only exists because what we find there is qualitatively consistent with properties of numerical solutions obtained directly from \eqref{eq:einstein-eq-for-h}. So, it should be clear that perturbation theory is just a sort of mathematical shortcut. In particular, g-waves do not depend, in any shape or form, on its use. In fact, they don't even depend on the use of numerics. The full exact set of 10 nPDEs describing $g$ can be put in the form of quasi-linear wave equations without any extra set of conditions but the [harmonic gauge][wiki/harmonic-gauge] ones, $g^{\mu\nu} \Gamma_{\mu\nu}^{\lambda} = 0$, where $ \Gamma_{\mu\nu}^{\lambda} $ are the Christoffel symbols.

## Plane g-waves 

Now we put all the caveats of the previous section aside, and unreservedly substitute \eqref{eq:formal-power-series} in \eqref{eq:einstein-eq-for-h}. The $n=0$ order in a power series is just a constant. Minkowski plus a constant is diffeomorphically Minkowski again. Thus, at this order, the substitution just trivially results in the statement that Minkowski is globally flat --- something we already knew. Now, at $n=1$ order, the substituting now reads

$$ \Box h^{(1)}_{\mu \nu} = 0 \;, \label{eq:g-wave-eq} \tag{3}$$ 

where $ h_{\mu \nu} \equiv h (\partial_{\mu}, \partial_{\nu}) $, and $\Box \equiv \eta^{\mu\nu} \partial_\mu \partial_\nu$ is the d'Alembertian differential operator. This is something new. In fact, the equations in \eqref{eq:g-wave-eq} are the classic linear wave equations!

These are contradictory premises because only analytic functions equal power series. Thus, the equal sign in \eqref{eq:formal-power-series} is really sketchy from a mathematical standpoint.

$$ \Box h^{(n)}_{\mu \nu} = N^{(n)}_{\mu \nu} \;, $$ 

where $N^{(n)}_{\mu \nu}$ is a non-linear function depending on $h^{(n-1)}_{\mu \nu}$.


at the same time that It has no obligation to equal a power series, which is a property of analytic objects. The right hand side of \eqref{eq:formal-power-series} is what mathematicians call a [formal power series][wiki/formal-power-series]. It is sum of a infinite number of term which has no obligation to converge to a finite value. Thus, the equality in \eqref{eq:formal-power-series} is the really sketchy part.

We're advancing, but at this point we still don't know much about $h$ because Einstein's equations in \eqref{eq:einstein-eq-for-h} are still too hard to solve. What we can qualitatively infer is that, in realistic physical scenarios, $h$ is at most smooth. This fact makes the next step a little bit sketchy from a mathematical standpoint. To be able to solve \eqref{eq:einstein-eq-for-h} without the aid of a supercomputer, we'll have to assume that $h$ can be expanded in a power series, 

%$$ h = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} h^{(n)} \;, \label{eq:formal-power-series} \tag{2}$$
