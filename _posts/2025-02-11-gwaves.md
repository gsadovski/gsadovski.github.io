## Introduction

Gravitational waves (g-waves) are propagating modes of the gravitational field, and an old prediction from general relativity (GR). They were first proposed in 1916 by A. Einstein himself, and have have a tensorial and massless nature. Additionally, g-waves can only be produced by energy-momentum distributions with non-vanishing 2nd order time derivative of their quadrupole moment.

G-waves in GR are analog of the electromagnetic waves in Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism. And, just like light, carry important information about their source. They are irreplaceable when all other channels of radiation (electromagnetic, neutrinos, cosmic rays, etc.) are blocked. For instance, when two black holes coalesce (a BH-BH merger).

This is why g-waves were such a big news a few years back. The first ever detection happened in 2015, when the interferometry observatories LIGO and VIRGO simultaneously observed the same BH-BH merger, 1.3 billion light-years away from Earth {% cite ligo2016a %}. This event, named [GW150914][wiki/GW150914], was completely invisible to us otherwise (see Video 1). Thus, its detection represented the birth of a completely new era in astronomy, similar to the first use of the telescope to observe the night sky, done by Galileo Galilei in 1609. 

G-waves can also be used in addition to other channels, when they are unblocked. This is known as *multichannel* or *multi-messenger astronomy*, and has the potential to revolutionize astrophysics. For example, our understanding of coalescing neutron stars (NS-NS mergers). Such events emit weaker signals, as they consist of much smaller masses. So, it took longer to detect. But, in 2017, it finally happened. [GW170817][wiki/GW170817] was the first (and, so far, the only) NS-NS merger observed via g-waves {% cite ligo2017a %}.

Approximately 1.7s after GW170817, its electromagnetic counterpart arrived in the form of a [short gamma-ray burst][wiki/grb], detected by the Fermi and INTEGRAL space telescopes. Finally, approximately 11hs later, the optical part revealed itself as a [kilonova][wiki/kilonova], ~140 million light-years away in the lenticular galaxy NGC4994, located at the Hydra constellation. The kilonova was observed by traditional telescopes all around Earth, and lasted a few weeks shinning across all the electromagnetic spectrum --- from X-rays to visible light to infrared (check Video 2).

## What are gravitational waves? 

Just like one recognizes small ripples propagating across a lake as water waves (Figure 1), one could recognize small ripples rolling across the fabric of spacetime as g-waves. This is, of course, quite an idealized scenario, but which helps us understand and easily visualize wave phenomena.

In reality, we know most waves are quite messy and difficult to precisely describe. To illustrate, it is enough to consider a windy day. The surface of the lake might become so choppy it might be hard to distinguish ripples from their surroundings (Figure 2). The lack of clear separation might force you to point to the whole lake as a single wavy mess. And to describe it mathematically, in a nice closed form, might be extremely hard, if not impossible.

The same can happen to spacetime, *e.g.*, in the vicinity of a BH-BH merger. In fact, GW150914 produced so much energy in the form of g-waves, one would have to imagine a wind turbine so powerful, it would outshine the light production of all the stars in the entire observable universe. This was the level of chaos unleashed. Video 3 illustrate how choppy spacetime got in the vicinity of GW150914. Pay attention to the last 20 milliseconds, this is when the g-wave production peaked, and the power output outshone the observable universe 50 times over!

G-waves can very easily produce a messy environment due to their natural non-linear behavior. They are dynamically described by Einstein's field equations, which consist of 10 non-linear partial differential equations (nPDEs). In vacuum, they read $\mathrm{Ric} = 0$, and look deceptively simple. However, they imply g-waves are described by the curvature of spacetime, and also that g-waves produce and interact with the curvature of spacetime. This is known as *backreaction*, and has important net effects: g-waves can refract, redshift, backscatter, damp, *etc*, all in vacuum.

For comparison, electromagnetic waves are much more well-behaved. Dynamically, they are described by Maxwell's equations which are linear PDEs. In some sense, they are still curvature, but linearity means that it does not interact with itself. Thus, to be messy, light really needs to interact with matter or with gravity. Only then it refracts, redshifts, backscatters, damps, *etc*.

In addition to the messiness of g-waves, a particularly energetic one can, in principle, undergo gravitational collapse. If focused on a small enough region, it can produce a black hole which destroys a portion of spacetime (geodesic incompleteness). We can hardly call this g-wave a ripple. A catastrophic megatsunami might be more fitting.

It should be clear real g-wave phenomena are extremely complex. In fact, when serious astrophysicists want to realistically simulate g-wave production, they have no choice but to numerically solve the full set of nPDEs in a supercomputer. Unfortunately, I am not a serious astrophysicist. The g-waves we're going to discuss next can be written down in terms of elementary functions like $\sin(x)$, $\cos(x)$, $e^x$, *etc*. Mathematically, they are very nice. However, we know now that "nice mathematics" cannot cope with the richness of g-waves. In other words, these solutions don't really exist in nature --- they are too idealized. Nevertheless, they still carry some qualitative features shared with real g-waves. So, I hope you can still find them interesting and illuminating.

## PP-wave spacetimes

We start with idealized but exact g-wave solutions. Due to how this subject is taught in undergrad courses all around the world, there is a misconception, even among physicists, that we first need to linearize $ \mathrm{Ric} = 0 $ in order to get wavy solutions. In other words, that we first need to throw away the non-linearities of gravity, making it behave more similar to electromagnetism. This is, however, not true. There is a whole class of exact g-waves solutions known as *plane-fronted waves with parallel propagation* (pp-waves). Admittedly, they are not as immediate to intuitively visualize as linear g-waves are.

First, consider spacetime to be a Lorentzian 4-manifold $\left(X,g\right)$, where $g(x)$ is known as *the metric tensor field*. The latter gives us a recipe on how to measure angles and sizes at each event $x \in X$ of spacetime. This is important. Field $g(x)$ is what comes out as solutions to Einstein's field equations. In other words, it is the fundamental descriptor of gravity in GR.

The family of pp-wave spacetimes consists of all $\left(X, g\right)$ which admits a covariantly constant null vector field $k$. This means $k$ needs to satisfy $g \left(k, k\right) = 0$ and $\nabla k = 0$. The physics savvy reader might be already suspicious that $k$ is the well-known wave vector --- you're right! Notice as well that this definition is independent of physics, it exclusively involved mathematical conditions belonging to the realm of Lorentzian geometry. In fact, a null vector field is always guaranteed to locally exist. What is actually restrictive is the covariantly constant condition, which also makes pp-wave spacetimes mathematically interesting as they contain Petrov type N regions.

Pp-wave spacetimes locally admit the Brinkmann coordinate patch, defined as $\left(u, v, x, y\right) \; ; \; u \in \left(u_0,u_1\right),\; v,x,y \in \left(-\infty, +\infty\right) $, where $k= \partial_{v}$. On it, the metric tensor assumes the form
<div style="margin-top: -20px; margin-bottom: 0px;">
$$ g(x) = H \left(u,x,y\right) du^2 + 2 dudv + \overbrace{dx^2 + dy^2}^{\mathbb{E}^2} \;,  $$ 
</div>
where $H \left(u, x, y\right)$ is analytic on the $xy$ Euclidean submanifold, $\mathbb{E}^2$, but otherwise arbitrary.

Finally, physics kicks in when we demand $g(x)$ to be a solution of $\mathrm{Ric} = 0$. One can show this is equivalent to demand $H$ to be harmonic on $\mathbb{E}^2$. Explicitly, $ \Delta H(u, x, y) = 0$, where $ \Delta \equiv \partial_{x}\partial_{x} + \partial_{y} \partial_{y}$ is the Laplacian differential operator on $\mathbb{E}^2$. No surprise, Einstein's equations demand $H$ to oscillate (like a wave) in the $xy$ direction. In fact, surfaces of constant $(v_0,u_0)$ can be interpreted as propagating wavefronts.

Clearly, $H$ encodes the particular details of each solution. For instance, if $H = 0$ the metric is just flat Minkowski. If $H$ has compact support the solution can be interpreted as g-wave packet (a pulse). If $H$ is quadratic in $xy$, the wavefronts have plane geometry (plane g-waves). And so forth.

## Post-Minkowskian g-waves

Exact solutions aside, let's address the more pedagogical approach usually taught in undergrad courses. First, we establish the simplest solution to Einstein's equations in vacuum is the already mentioned Minkowski spacetime. This is the globally flat manifold, denoted by $\left(X,\eta\right)$ where 

$$ \eta \left(x\right) = -dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 \;, $$ 

and $t,x,y,z \in \left(-\infty, +\infty\right)$ is the globally defined Cartezian patch. Because Minkowski is everywhere flat, it is also destitute of any gravitational fields. One could say it is the *lowest energy*, most boring solution of $\mathrm{Ric} = 0$. Thus, it is the perfect background to study how ripples propagate.

Second, we want to describe a scenario similar to Figure 1, where there is a clear separation between ripples and their surrounding background. In other words, a solution equivalent to "$\eta$ plus ripples". Mathematically, we propose $g' = f^{\ast} g \; ; \; g' \equiv \eta + h$, where $f: \left(X,g'\right) \rightarrow \left(X,g\right)$ is a diffeomorphism.

The equation $g' = f^{\ast} g$ means $g$ is equivalent to $g'$. This is because Einstein's field equations are covariant under transformation $f$. Saying it differently, $g$ and $g'$ represent the same physical solution: Minkowski with ripples. To be clear, $h$ is a symmetric rank-2 tensor field representing these ripples. Mathematically, if $g$ is a solution, then $g'$ is a solution as well, which means $\mathrm{Ric} \left(g', \partial g', \partial^{2} g'\right) = 0$. Moreover, we also know $\eta$ is yet another solution --- in fact, the globally constant most boring one, $\partial \eta = \partial^2 \eta = 0$ --- which brings the final result to

$$\mathrm{Ric} \left(\eta, h, \partial h, \partial^2 h\right) = 0 \;. \label{eq:einstein-eq-for-h} \tag{1}$$

We clearly achieved separation since Einstein's equations now became differential only for $h$. One could say we're now dealing with a traditional $h$ field theory over a fixed Minkowski background. This is known as the *post-Minkowskian regime* of GR. The only "problem" is that \eqref{eq:einstein-eq-for-h} is still nonlinear, which means complicated dynamics and potentially messy solutions just like before. Our next step is to find a way to simplify this by discarding all of these non-linearities, making gravity more similar to the electromagnetism.

## Perturbation theory 

The messiness brought by non-linearities can also manifest in the real world as caustics, shockwaves, phase transitions, turbulence, singularities, *etc*. Thus, it is nothing but reasonable to expect $h$ to be, at the very most, a $C^{\infty}$ (smooth) field. In fact, \eqref{eq:einstein-eq-for-h} only demands it to be $C^2$ (twice differentiable). Figure 2, again, represents quite an extreme case (but not at all uncommon) in which smoothness is definitely absent, and $C^0$ (continuity) is quite questionable.

One way to control these complexities is to demand $h$ to be $C^{\omega}$ (analytic). This is quite a restrictive assumption, which is only truely satisfied by a very small fraction of all possible solutions to \eqref{eq:einstein-eq-for-h}. Analyticity forbids caustics, singularities, phase transitions, *etc.*, but also $h$ to be compactly supported on $X$. If a $C^{\omega}$ solution has compact support, then it is necessarily trivial (everywhere vanishing). This is because every $C^{\omega}$ solution is globally determined by its behavior in a local neighborhood of its domain, which is itself a non-causal feature. If it vanishes somewhere, it has to vanish everywhere. Thus, every non-trivial $C^{\omega}$ solution is necessarily eternal and omnipresent (globally type N), and incapable of describing g-wave generation by localized sources.

At times, analyticity might be a physical sacrifice worth paying for. Pedagogically, $C^\omega$ solutions are easier to understand and visualize. They are computationally simple to obtain. And, physically, some of them still share qualitative features with their more physical non-analytic counterparts. If $h$ is assumed $C^{\omega}$ on $X$, then it has an exact representation in terms of a Taylor series,

$$ h (x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!}\nabla_{\dot{\gamma}(0)}^{(n)} h \mid_{\gamma (0)} \;, \label{eq:taylor-series} \tag{2}$$ 

where $\gamma: [0,1] \rightarrow X$ is a curve connecting $\gamma (0) \equiv x_0 $ to $\gamma (1) \equiv x$. Again, the right-hand side of \eqref{eq:taylor-series} is a convergent power series locally defined in the neighborhood of $x_0$, but which determines $h(x)$ over the entire $X$.

A less restrictive way to control the non-linearities is to assume the domain of $h$ admits an asymptotic scale, denoted by the set of fields $ \\{ h^{(n)}(x) \\} $. In this case, $h$ just needs to be $C^{0}$, and we technically keep most of its non-analytic behavior. However, there is a mathematical price to be paid. Equation \eqref{eq:taylor-series} is eroded into an equivalence to an [asymptotic expansion][wiki/asymptotic-series],

$$h(x) \sim \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} h^{(n)}\;. \label{eq:asymptotic-series} \tag{3}$$ 

The right-hand side of \eqref{eq:asymptotic-series} is what mathematicians call a [formal series][wiki/formal-series]. Contrasting \eqref{eq:taylor-series}, this infinite sum has no obligation to converge to a finite quantity, much less one equals to $h(x)$. Fortunately, \eqref{eq:asymptotic-series} is not pure mathematical wizardry, and we can give a rigorous meaning to $\sim$. For any finite truncation, the reminder 

$$ \mathcal{R}_N (x) \equiv h - \sum_{n=0}^N h^{(n)} $$

has to be strictly smaller than the leading order as $x$ approaches the future null infinity $\mathcal{I}^+$ of $\left(X,\eta\right)$. With this restriction, it is possible to define an equivalence class in which \eqref{eq:asymptotic-series} rigorously holds.

Physicists like to call either of these techniques *perturbation theory*. The goal is to find a truncation of either \eqref{eq:taylor-series} or \eqref{eq:asymptotic-series}, depending on your assumptions, which approximates "well enough" the exact solution you're trying to study. The higher the truncation order you need, the bigger is the piece you have to evaluate. The bigger the piece, the better the approximation is. However, these methods have quickly diminishing returns.

The leading order is always the 1st, which is also the linear limit. Beyond leading order truncations represents non-linear effects being carefully introduced as ever smaller corrections. At high orders, we pay a very large computational price for a very tiny improvement. Thus, most research is done at the leading order. However, it is not uncommon for a theoretical physicist to consider 2nd order truncations because they also give us a good idea of the overall beyond leading order behavior, and how the first non-linear effects appear. In what follows, it will be enough to consider the leading order.

## Linear g-waves 

The $N=0$ truncation is just a constant. Minkowski plus a constant is diffeomorphically Minkowski again. Thus, the $0$-th order truncation is too low to result in anything interesting. Substituting \eqref{eq:asymptotic-series}, truncated at $N=0$, into \eqref{eq:einstein-eq-for-h}, just trivially results in the statement that Minkowski is globally flat --- again, something we already know.

Now, as stated before, the 1st order is the leading order, which is also the linear limit. Substituting \eqref{eq:asymptotic-series}, truncated at $N=1$, into \eqref{eq:einstein-eq-for-h}, results in

$$ \Box h^{(1)} = 0 \;, \label{eq:linear-g-wave} \tag{4}$$ 

where $\Box \equiv \partial \cdot \partial$ is the d'Alembertian differential operator on Minkowski spacetime, and the *traceless-tranverse* (TT) gauge condition, $\partial \cdot \bar{h}^{(1)} = 0$, was used[^traceless-tranverse]. Now, this is something new. In fact, this is what Einstein found in 1916. Apart from the fact $h^{(1)}$ is tensorial, \eqref{eq:linear-g-wave} is the same as the equation which governs the dynamical behavior of electromagnetic waves in vacuum! In other words, at leading order in the post-Minkowskian approximation, Einstein's field equations forces $h$ to behave as a traditional linear wave.

For an arbitrary truncation, we generally end up with

$$ \Box h^{(N)} = f^{(N)} \;, $$ 

where $f^{(N)}$ is a function depending non-linearly on $h^{(N-1)}$ and its derivatives. So, the beyond leading order behavior is also clear. The $N$-th order non-linearities, contained in $f^{(N)}$, are constructed out of the $(N-1)$-th order solutions, and behave as sources for $h^{(N)}$. Again, we see that non-linearities introduce self-interactions: in beyond leading order, g-waves generate g-waves.

[^traceless-tranverse]: The traceless-transverse of $h^{(1)}$ is defined as $ \bar{h}^{(1)} \equiv h^{(1)} - \frac{1}{2} \eta \tr \left(h^{(1)}\right) $.
