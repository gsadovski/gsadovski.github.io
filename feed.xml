Given the complexity of these dynamical equations, it is not immediately clear that General Relativity (GR) is a deterministic theory.</p> <p>Determinism is an important feature of physical theories. It implies that the whole past and future (the history) of a system can be evaluated, with infinite precision, from a minimal set of data. This makes deterministic theories extremely predictive, and thus appealing to the scientific framework.</p> <p>Mathematically, determinism can be captured by a system of equations whose solutions exist, and can be uniquely determined. Usually, the system is differential with respect to some affine parameter (time), and the minimal set of data is the Cauchy (initial) data. Systems like these are said to be a <em>well-posed Cauchy problem</em>.</p> <p>Examples in Physics are plenty: Newton’s 2nd Law, Newton’s Law of Gravitation, Maxwell’s equations, Schrödinger’s equation in the absence of measurements (collapses of the wave function), <em>etc</em>. Granted, these examples have much simpler dynamics than GR. Newton’s 2nd law and Schrödinger’s are ordinary differential equations. Newton’s Law of Gravitation and Maxwell’s are PDEs, but they are linear. Nonetheless, they reveal that what gives GR so much physical richness, is also what cripples its mathematical understanding, and possibly its predictability.</p> <p>A detailed study of GR’s dynamics needs to address the proof of existence and uniqueness of its solutions. As mentioned, a natural step is to attempt to formulate a well-posed Cauchy problem for Einstein’s equations. However, this has proven to be difficult to do.</p> <p>An important tool in this endeavor is the use of the harmonic gauge condition. In this gauge, Einstein’s equations assume the form of quasi-linear hyperbolic PDEs (wave-like equations). Choquet-Bruhat theorem then guarantees, at least, the <em>local</em> existence and uniqueness of solutions. In other words, GR is locally a well-posed Cauchy problem.</p> <p>The Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) formalism plays a major role in clarifying Choquet-Bruhat’s results. But it also implies a particular choice of global spacetime foliation. This is a more restricted framework, applicable to only a subspace of solutions.</p> <p>Finally, the <em>global</em> proof of existence and uniqueness is still an open problem in the mathematical-physics of GR. In fact, the theorems of existence of spacetime singularities, and the possible existence of Cauchy horizons indicate that a global proof might not exist. In other words, GR might not be a globally well-posed Cauchy problem.</p> <p>The Weak and Strong Cosmic Censorship Conjectures (CCCs) were formulated in an attempt to mitigate this situation. Nevertheless, recent and old results are pilling up against their validity. One is then left wondering how predictive GR really is.</p> <h2 id="the-harmonic-gauge">The harmonic gauge</h2> <p>GR has dynamics invariant under the group of diffeomorphisms among Lorentzian 4-manifolds. This means that its physical solutions are equivalence classes under these maps. Each class, or each physical solution, has many (actually, infinite) equivalent representatives. This enormous redundancy implies that Einstein’s equations are plagued with <em>gauge artifacts</em>, making them more complex than actually necessary to describe the physics of the gravitational field.</p> <p>Gauge fixing these redundancies give us a way to simplify Einstein’s equations without sacrificing its physical content. A cleaver choice is the so-called harmonic gauge fixing conditions, defined by 4 constraint equations,</p> \[\Box x^{\mu} = 0 \;,\] <p>where $\Box \equiv g^{\mu \nu} \nabla_{\mu} \nabla_{\nu}$ is the d’Alembertian differential operator.</p> <p>Applying the harmonic gauge conditions to Einstein’s equations in vacuum shapes them into the form</p> \[\tilde{\Box} g_{\mu \nu} = N_{\mu \nu} \left( g, \partial g\right) \;,\] <p>where $\tilde{\Box} \equiv g^{\mu\nu}\partial_{\mu}\partial_{\nu}$, and $N_{\mu \nu}$ is a smooth non-linear function up to the 1st derivative of $g_{\mu \nu}$. These are wave-like equations, mathematically classified as a set of 2nd order quasi-linear hyperbolic PDEs.</p> <p>Luckily, the branch of Analysis dealing with quasi-linear hyperbolic PDEs is more developed than the one of fully non-linear generic PDEs. For instance, if $N_{\mu \nu}$ were to be analytic, then the local existence and uniqueness would automatically follow due to the so-called Cauchy-Kowalevski theorem. Unluckily, $N_{\mu \nu}$ is smooth but non-analytical in most physical situations.</p> <p>In 1952, mathematical-physicist Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat managed to relax the analyticity condition via the use of Sobolev spaces (see <a href="https://inspirehep.net/literature/1322081">a review</a> by Yvonne herself). Her theorem was fully applicable to Einstein’s equation in the harmonic gauge, and thus guaranteed the local well-posedness of its Cauchy problem. In other words, Yvonne proved that GR has a deterministic evolution in a small enough neighborhood of its solution space.</p> <h2 id="the-adm-formalism">The ADM formalism</h2> <p>Let’s consider $\left(X, g_{\mu \nu}\right)$ a Lorentzian 4-manifold. If foliatable, there exists a diffeomorphism map $f: X \mapsto \mathbb{R}\times\Sigma$. This allows to define in $X$ a 1-parameter family of spacelike 3-manifolds, $\Sigma_{\lambda} \equiv {f}^{-1} \left(\left\{\lambda \right\} \times \Sigma \right) \; ; \; \lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, which are called the “leaves” in this foliation, check Figure 1.</p> <div align="center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/svg/foliation.webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/svg/foliation.webp" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Figure 1: Foliability of $X$. </div> </div> <p>Each leaf $\Sigma_{\lambda}$ has an induced 3-metric, $h_{ij} \left(\lambda\right)$, and an extrinsic curvature, $K_{ij} \left(\lambda\right)$. Furthermore, there also exists a globally well-defined, smooth, timelike vector field, $\partial_{\lambda}$, that generates a flow of time.</p> <p>Foliability implies something very mundane for all of us: that space and time are separable, almost orthogonal entities. We measure space with a ruler, time with a clock. Not ever a situation arose in which we needed both a rule and a clock to measure space, or a ruler and a clock to measure time. And, to be frank, this is always true as long as we are measuring a small enough neighborhood of spacetime (most of us never even left Earth anyway).</p> <p>In GR, however, foliability cannot always be guaranteed over the entire spacetime manifold (globally). Mind, this is a feature, not a bug, of GR’s full invariance under diffeomorphisms. Behind the scenes, the foliability condition actually selects solutions with partially broken invariance. A residual symmetry still exists on the leaves, but the breakage is just enough to allow a global notion of time, time evolution, initial data, <em>etc</em>. All welcomed ingredients for a well-posed Cauchy problem.</p> <p>The ADM formalism uses the foliability condition to split Einstein’s equations apart. Mind, there are many (infinite) ways to split Einstein’s equations apart, but the ADM one is remarkable because, by projecting Einstein’s equations onto the leaves, ADM precisely separates them in constraint <em>versus</em> dynamical equations. Concurrently, it establishes the trio $\left( \Sigma_{\lambda}, h_{ij}, K_{ij}\right)$ as their Cauchy data.</p> <h3 id="the-constraint-equations">The constraint equations</h3> <p>Not every Cauchy data $\left(\Sigma_{\lambda}, h_{ij}, K_{ij}\right)$ is compatible with a foliation of $\left(X, g_{\mu \nu}\right)$. The constraint equations exist to ensure this compatibility. Yvonne deduced these equations from energy estimates and properties of Sobolev spaces. But, using the ADM formalism, they naturally pop up as follows.</p> <p>Let $\pi_{ij} \equiv 4 \pi \sqrt{h} \left( K_{ij} - h_{ij} K \right) \; ; \; K \equiv h^{ij}K_{ij} $ be the conjugated momenta of $h_{ij}$. Einstein’s equation, $R_{00} = 0$, when projected onto the leaves, $\Sigma_{\lambda}$, results in the now famous Hamiltonian constraint,</p> \[H = 0 \;,\] <p>where $H \equiv - \sqrt{h} \left[ R^h + h^{-1} \left( \pi^{2} - \pi_{ij}\pi^{ij} \right) \right] \; ; \; \pi \equiv h^{ij}\pi_{ij}$, and $R^h$ is the curvature scalar of $h_{ij}$. On the other hand, when $R_{0i} = 0$ is projected onto $\Sigma_{\lambda}$, the result is the momentum constraint equations</p> \[P^i = 0 \;,\] <p>where $P^i \equiv -2 \nabla_j \pi^{ij}$.</p> <p>Together, the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints form a system of 4 PDEs that every Cauchy data for Einstein’s equations have to obey.</p> <p>Here, we cannot avoid but mention that, in quantum gravity, these are the constraint equations that lead to the famous Wheeler-DeWitt equations,</p> \[\begin{aligned} \hat{H} \lvert \Psi \rangle &amp;= 0 \;, \\ \hat{P}^i \lvert \Psi \rangle &amp;= 0 \;, \end{aligned}\] <p>for the quantum state $\lvert \Psi \rangle$ of the Universe. As well as to the problem of time, Ashtekar variables (a complex self-dual formulation of GR), and the loop representation of Carlo Rovelli and Lee Smolin, finally giving birth to Loop Quantum Gravity.</p> <h3 id="the-dynamical-ones">The dynamical ones</h3> <p>We discussed how Yvonne evolved her constrained set of Cauchy data via Einstein’s equations in the harmonic gauge. It turns out that the ADM formalism produces an even simpler description.</p> <p>First, let us establish that the flow of time happens in the direction of the vector field $\partial_{\lambda} = \alpha \hat{n} + \vec{\beta}$, where $\alpha$ is the so-called lapse function, $\hat{n}$ is the unit vector normal to $\Sigma_{\lambda}$, and $\vec{\beta}$ the displacement vector implicitly given by the orthogonality condition $\hat{n} \cdot \vec{\beta} = 0$, see Figure 2.</p> <p>The dynamical evolution of $h_{ij}$ can be obtained from the very definition of the extrinsic curvature. Explicitly, $K_{ij} \equiv - L_{\alpha \hat{n}} h_{ij} / 2$, where $L_{\alpha \hat{n}}$ is the Lie derivative along $\alpha\hat{n}$. Solving for $L_{\partial_{\lambda}} h_{ij}$, one arrives at</p> \[\partial_{\lambda} h_{ij} = - 2 K_{ij} + L_{\vec{\beta}} h_{ij} \;.\] <p>This is a set of 10 quasi-linear 1st order PDEs, which give how the intrinsic local 3-geometry changes as we pass from one leaf, let’s say $\Sigma_{\lambda}$, to another infinitesimally close to it, let’s say $\Sigma_{\lambda + d\lambda}$.</p> <p>On the other hand, the dynamical evolution for $K_{ij}$ is given by the projection of Einstein’s equations, $R_{ij} = 0$, onto the leaves. Explicitly,</p> \[\partial_{\lambda} K_{ij} = \alpha \left[ R_{ij}^h + K_{ij} K - 2 K_{ik} K_j^k \right] \;,\] <p>where $R_{ij}^h$ is the Ricci tensor of $h_{ij}$. This is another set of 10 quasi-linear 1st order PDEs, which give how the local curvature, due to how the leaves “sit inside $X$”, changes within the infinitesimal time interval that separates $\Sigma_{\lambda}$ and $\Sigma_{\lambda + d\lambda}$.</p> <p>Now, it is supposed to be clear that we can exchange Einstein’s equations in the harmonic gauge, used by Yvonne and given by 10 2nd order PDEs, with the 20 1st order PDEs in the ADM formulation. Surely, we now have double the equations to solve, but they are also way simpler. This is in full analogy with the passage from the Lagrangian to the Hamiltonian formulation of Classical Mechanics. Particularly how $n$ Euler-Lagrange equations becomes $2n$ Hamilton’s equations. In fact, one way to interpret the ADM formalism is as a Hamiltonian description of GR.</p> <p>We stress that if GR is indeed fully deterministic, these dynamical equations can be used to evolve the Cauchy data $\left(\Sigma_{\lambda}, h_{ij}, K_{ij}\right)$ to ANY other leaf in the foliation, see Figure 3. This would be equivalent to know the entire plot of a movie from just a screenshot (unfortunately, not a rare occurrence these days). However, here the movie is the entire history of the Universe. This is what theoretical physicists and mathematicians mean when they speak of “a well-posed Cauchy problem for GR”.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/svg/timeflow.webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/svg/timeflow.webp" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Figure 2: Flow of time. </div> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/svg/evolution.webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/svg/evolution.webp" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Figure 3: Evolution of Cauchy data. </div> </div> </div> <h2 id="global-well-posedness">Global well-posedness</h2> <p>Two milestones towards the global proof of existence of solutions are: i) the <a href="https://inspirehep.net/literature/370148">1993 Christodoulou-Klainerman</a> theorem and; ii) the <a href="https://inspirehep.net/literature/614941">2003 Andersson-Moncrief</a> theorem.</p> <p>Result i) establishes the stability of Minkowski spacetime under small Cauchy data. In other words, the Minkowski solution exists for arbitrarily long periods of time and, solutions in its neighborhood tend to settle back towards it. This can also be interpreted as a theorem of non-existence of singularities in the space of solutions around Minkowski’s.</p> <p>Result ii) is similar in spirit and technique to i). It establishes the future stability of <em>hyperbolic cone spacetimes</em>, also for small enough Cauchy data. These are compactified variants of the familiar $\kappa = -1$ FLRW cosmological solutions, admitting foliations of constant mean curvature, <em>i.e.</em>, $\left\{\Sigma_{\lambda} \; ; \; K = \text{const.}\right\}$. The interpretation is analogous to the Minkowski’s case.</p> <p>As one can see, though important, the above theorems cover only very localized areas in the space of all solutions. In fact, to this day, we still lack a theorem that ensures existence of arbitrary solutions to Einstein’s equations. Thus, we can already conclude that the global well-posedness represents a major open problem in the mathematical-physics of GR. For completeness, let’s now address the global uniqueness.</p> <p>First, consider a differentiable timelike curve, $\gamma(\lambda) \; ; \; g \left(\gamma,\gamma\right) &lt; 0$, which extends indefinitely to the past and to the future (also called <em>inextensible</em>). A Cauchy surface $S$ is a subset of $X$ punctured only once by every inextensible differentiable timelike curve in $X$. This has already being qualitatively depicted in Figure 3 for a single curve. The single point of intersection captures, in essence, the uniqueness of Cauchy data in each leaf.</p> <p>Going back to the Choquet-Bruhat theorem, the local proof of uniqueness is in one-to-one correspondence with the existence of a Cauchy surface within the infinitesimal time interval $d \lambda$. In fact, one can always find a convenient local foliation in which every leaf is a Cauchy surface, also called a Cauchy foliation. Then, it is natural to expect that Yvonne’s theorem remains valid in a larger piece of spacetime as long as it admits a Cauchy foliation, like in Figure 3.</p> <p>In 1969, Yvonne, now collaborating with Robert Geroch, developed the concept of a <em>maximal globally hyperbolic developed</em> (MGHD), and proved its uniqueness up to diffeomorphisms. This is the largest possible piece of spacetime that admits a Cauchy foliation. And, thus, for which Einstein’s equations imply a deterministic evolution. In particular, the <a href="https://inspirehep.net/literature/59617">Choquet-Bruhat-Geroch result</a> represents a global uniqueness theorem for solutions diffeomorphic to a MGHD. These are called <em>globally hyperbolic spacetimes</em>.</p> <p>The expectation that the space of all solutions to Einstein’s equations contained exclusively globally hyperbolic spacetimes was, ironically, short-lived. By 1970, the Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems were fully developed. In the presence of spacetime singularities, inextensible differentiable timelike curves acquire finite proper time (they end). Thus, singularities represent boundaries for the MGHD. Additionally, they can spoil the global well-posedness in a number of other way, <em>e.g.</em>, uniqueness can be broken by caustics (the focusing of geodesics into a single point), see Figure 4.</p> <p>Penrose also very clearly defined the concept of Cauchy horizons (CHs). These are boundaries for the MGHD beyond which there are inextensible differentiable timelike curves that never punctured a Cauchy surface in the MGHD. In other words, a fragment of the movie that couldn’t be predicted from the initial snapshot.</p> <p>CHs are inevitable when closed timelike curves (CTCs) are present, <em>e.g.</em>, inside rotating black holes. CTC is just a fancy name for time travel. It breaks uniqueness by puncturing the would-be Cauchy surface many times over, see figure 5.</p> <p>Clearly, all these results indicated the very real (and embarrassing) possibility that GR indeed is not a globally well-posed theory, <em>i.e.</em>, it is not deterministic.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/svg/singularity.webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/svg/singularity.webp" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Figure 4: A spacetime caustic. </div> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/svg/cauchyhorizon.webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/svg/cauchyhorizon.webp" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Figure 5: A Cauchy horizon harboring CTCs. </div> </div> </div> <h2 id="cosmic-censorship-conjectures">Cosmic Censorship Conjectures</h2> <p>The apparent ill-posedness of GR immediately bothered Penrose himself, making him conjecture that every singularity must be “hidden” inside an event horizon, known as the Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (WCCC), and that Cauchy horizons are mathematical artifacts, unstable under metric perturbations. Thus, they could never survive gravitational collapse and form in Nature. This is known as the Strong Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (SCCC). If true, these conjectures would restore the deterministic nature of Einstein’s equations, even if only for infinitely far away (asymptotic) observers.</p> <p>Since the 1970s, there was a strong expectation in the scientific community that Penrose’s CCCs would eventually be proven true. Indeed, since then, we struggled to find any natural process able to generate stable naked singularities (singularities not “dressed” by an event horizon). If they do exist, they are quite rare. In addition, there is mounting evidence that Cauchy horizons are inherently unstable if matter fields respect the Weak Energy Conditions (WECs).</p> <p>So, how come, we are in the year 2025, and there is still no consensus in the scientific community about the real predictive power of GR? Well, the answer is, at least, 3-fold.</p> <p>Firstly, we know since the 1990s that WCCC is mathematically false. Physicists <a href="https://inspirehep.net/literature/34598">P. S. Joshi, I. H. Dwivedi</a>, <a href="https://inspirehep.net/literature/1235882">D. Christodoulou</a>, and others, have proven that naked singularities can form in specific cases through the collapse of matter. These results led famous physicist Stephen Hawking to <a href="https://www.preskill.caltech.edu/old_naked_bet.html">concede his original bet</a> against naked singularities. Indeed, GR appears to have no internal mechanism to prevent their formation.</p> <p>The only caveat is that these examples heavily rely on a specific set of Cauchy data (<em>e.g.</em>, with perfect spherical symmetry). Nonetheless, it might be only a matter of time until we figure out processes capable of generating them under very few assumptions, making naked singularities generic enough to occur in Nature.</p> <p>Secondly, SCCC may not hold true when quantum effects are taken into account. Quantum fields do not always adhere to WECs, and quantum gravity effects may further complicate this discussion. Either of these factors could potentially stabilize the Cauchy horizon, making it long-lived.</p> <p>Thirdly, and finally, SCCC has been proven mathematically false twice now, regardless of quantum effects. In 2003, M. Dafermos developed a <a href="https://inspirehep.net/literature/622602">proof of existence of the region across the CH inside charged (Reissner-Nordström) black holes</a>. And, in 2017, Dafermos and J. Luk, managed to develop a <a href="https://inspirehep.net/literature/1628644">similar proof for the CH inside rotating (Kerr) black holes</a>.</p> <p>The caveat is that these proofs hold only in the category of continuous spacetimes. The inherent instability of CHs when WECs are satisfied does not mean its interior region collapses out of existence into a singularity, as previously thought. Instead, in a much less dramatic manner, its smoothness ($C^\infty$ differentiability) collapses into just continuity ($C^0$). Black holes’ CHs, its interior region, and the metric field there survive the gravitational collapse but as continuous non-differentiable structures. Fair enough, if the metric is only $C^0$, then Einstein’s equations are not even valid there. And, once again, we are unable to draw further conclusions about their well-posedness.</p> <h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2> <p>GR’s situation looks grim at the moment. So much so, we are left to discuss sociological aspects of Physics.</p> <p>Most physicists today have adopted the optimistic view that “GR is such a good theory that it predicts its own demise”. And, that its ultraviolet completion, whatever it is, will clarify the nature of singularities, Cauchy horizons, <em>etc</em>., ultimately reestablishing the global well-posedness of the spacetime evolution.</p> <p>On the other hand, there is also the pessimistic (or realistic, depending on where you sit) branch. This branch takes these results at face value, and points out less singular alternatives to GR as paths forward. Additionally, it emphasizes that quantum gravity, something which we don’t agree on what it is even after +100 years of research, has no obligation to solve these issues. If it will, it’s anyone’s guess right now.</p> <p>Personally, I sit fuzzily in the middle. I acknowledge the optimistic point of view, which might very well be the path forward. However, I also cannot help but sense a bit of biased effort to save GR. To spin the narrative, and turn a bug into a feature via marketing tactics. I do not particularly subscript to this aspect of the optimistic branch.</p> <p>The pessimistic branch generally have good points. Alternatives to GR, sometimes for historical rather than scientific reasons, have been side lined. It immediately comes to my mind the Einstein-Cartan theory of gravity, which is capable of producing regular black holes and cosmological solutions, while fully agreeing with GR otherwise. However, I am also not convinced these alternatives are globally well-posed Cauchy problems. They tend to be less singular, yes, but singularities can still occur and global ill-posedness follows.</p> <p>Ironically, it seems that the resolution of all these problems might lie in our future Cauchy development.</p>]]></content><author><name>Guilherme Sadovski</name></author><category term="physics"/><category term="gr-qc"/><category term="math-phys"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An account of the Cauchy problem for Einstein's equations.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Symmetries and charges</title><link href="https://gsadovski.github.io/blog/2025/noether/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Symmetries and charges"/><published>2025-01-09T15:48:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-01-09T15:48:00+00:00</updated><id>https://gsadovski.github.io/blog/2025/noether</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://gsadovski.github.io/blog/2025/noether/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>Amalie Emmy Noether is widely recognized as the most influential woman in the history of mathematics. Among her brilliant work, two theorems formulated in 1915 are known by every theoretical physicist. Noether’s theorems have impacted every branch of physics that involves the continuous evolution of a dynamical system.</p> <p>In mathematics, they are an important result in functional analysis and play a foundational role in algebraic topology, particularly the idea that algebraic structures can capture invariant properties of a space.</p> <p>The theorems establish a rigorous connection between the continuous symmetries of a dynamical system and its conservation laws. In classical and quantum field theory, they clarify how the presence of symmetries can constrain the dynamics, define charges, and even determine the physical states of a model.</p> <p>The theorems work in both directions. The presence of constrained dynamics and conserved charges also implies the existence of underlying symmetries. This is an extremely powerful result that shaped most of the 20th century physics.</p> <h2 id="prelude-in-classical-field-theory">Prelude in classical field theory</h2> <p>To begin, let’s consider $X$ a $n$-dimensional spacetime, and $\phi \left(x\right) \; ; \; x \in X$ a tensorial field over it with dynamics defined by the action functional</p> \[S \left[ \phi \right] \equiv \int_{X} \mathcal{L} \left( \phi, d \phi \right) \;,\] <p>where $d$ is the exterior derivative, and $\mathcal{L} \left( \phi, d \phi \right)$ is the $n$-form Lagrangian.</p> <p>Under an infinitesimal field variation, $\phi \mapsto \phi’ = \phi + \delta \phi$, which vanishes at the boundary $\partial X$ of $X$, the action functional will vary accordingly,</p> \[\delta S \left[\phi\right] = \int_{X} {\delta}^{(1)}_{\phi} \mathcal{L} \delta\phi \;,\] <p>where $ {\delta}^{(1)}_{\phi} \equiv \frac{\partial }{\partial \phi} - d \left[ \frac{\partial }{\partial \left(d \phi\right)}\right] $ is the Euler-Lagrange operator.</p> <p>Hamilton’s principle ($\delta S = 0$) then implies the Euler-Lagrange field equations</p> \[\delta^{(1)}_{\phi} \mathcal{L} = 0 \;,\] <p>which govern the classical dynamics of this field theory. In particular, its solutions are the extrema of $S$, and comprise the so-called “on-shell” configurations of $\phi$.</p> <h2 id="what-are-symmetries">What are symmetries?</h2> <p>First, consider a $\alpha$-parameter family of infinitesimal variations, $ \phi \mapsto \phi’ = \phi + \delta_{\xi ^{a}}\phi $ with $a \in \left\{1, \cdots, \alpha\right\} $, that do not necessarily vanish at $\partial X$. This family of field transformations is said to be continuous, $C^k$-differentiable, smooth, <em>etc.</em>, if the fields $\xi^{a} = \xi^a (x)$ are. For instance, if $\xi^a (x)$ are constants, the transformations are said to be global, otherwise they are local.</p> <p>We assume that $\delta_{\xi^{a}}\phi$ satisfy the axioms of an algebra. This algebra is finite-dimensional if the transformations are global, or infinite-dimensional if they are local. Very important examples in high-energy physics are the BRST and the Lie algebras. One should point out that, among these, only finite-dimensional Lie algebras are necessarily associated with the local properties of Lie groups. Symmetries are more widely associated with algebras, not groups.</p> <p>Second, $\xi^a$ are the elements of a quasi-symmetry algebra (of a classical field theory) if</p> \[\delta_{\xi^{a}} S = \int_{\partial X} K_{\xi^{a}} \;,\] <p>where $K_{\xi^{a}}$ is an $(n-1)$-form depending arbitrarily on $\phi$ and $d \phi$.</p> <p>Clearly, quasi-symmetries are on-shell exact-symmetries of a field theory since boundary terms do not contribute to the Euler-Lagrange field equations.</p> <h2 id="noethers-1st-theorem">Noether’s 1st theorem</h2> <p>The quasi-symmetry conditions above, when developed for the case of global transformations, lead to the so-called Noether identities,</p> \[\delta_{\phi}^{(1)} \mathcal{L} \delta_{\xi^{a}} \phi + d J_{\xi^{a}} = 0 \;, \tag{1}\label{eq:noetheridentities}\] <p>where</p> \[J_{\xi^{a}} \equiv \left[\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \left(d \phi\right)}\right] \delta_{\xi^{a}} \phi - K_{\xi^{a}}\] <p>are the so-called Noether currents.

Explicitly, \eqref{eq:noetheridentities} reduces on-shell to a continuity equation, $d J_{\xi^{a}} = 0$. In other words, the presence of $\alpha$ global quasi-symmetry generators implies $\alpha$ on-shell conserved Noether currents, and <em>vice versa</em>. This is rigorously how symmetry algebra elements are connected to dynamical invariants.</p> <p>Finally, for each $J_{\xi^{a}}$ we have a so-called conserved Noether charge,</p> \[Q_{\xi^{a}} \equiv \int_{Y} J_{\xi^{a}} \;,\] <p>inside a spacelike $(n-1)$-submanifold $Y$ in $X$.</p> <h2 id="the-brst-symmetry-and-charge">The BRST symmetry and charge</h2> <p>As mentioned, the BRST symmetry algebra is an important example present in gauge theories of high-energy particle physics. Let’s consider the example of the Yang-Mills (YM) theories, which describe the ultraviolet dynamics of the strong and electronweak interactions. Classically, the YM dynamics is given by</p> \[S_{YM}[A] \equiv - \int_{X} \tr \left( F \star F \right) \;,\] <p>where $- \tr$ represents the Killing form on the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, $F=dA+A^2$ represents the $\mathfrak{g}$-valued 2-form curvature (field strength) of the $\mathfrak{g}$-valued 1-form connection $A$ (gauge field); and, $\star$ is the Hodge operator on $X$.</p> <p>The BRST algebra is a global exact-symmetry of YM action. Explicitly, $\delta_{BRST} S_{YM} = 0$ where $\delta_{BRST} A = -Dc$ and $\delta_{BRST} c = -c^2$; $D = d + \left[A, \phantom{A}\right] $ is the exterior covariant derivative in the adjoint representation; and $c$ is the $\mathfrak{g}$-valued 0-form Faddeev-Popov ghost field — introduced to make ${\delta_{BRST}}^2 = 0$.</p> <p>According to Noether’s 1st theorem, the BRST symmetry above then implies that the YM dynamics is off-shell constrained by \eqref{eq:noetheridentities}, and that there will be an on-shell conserved Noether current and charge, namely,</p> \[\begin{aligned} J_{BRST} &amp;= \tr \left( \star FDc \right) \;, \\ Q_{BRST} &amp;= \int_{Y} \tr \left( \star FDc\right) \;. \end{aligned}\] <p>In the absence of a gauge anomaly, the BRST symmetry survives the quantization process<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Noether identities resurrect as the so-called Slavnov-Taylor identities, which constrain the quantum correlation functions and guarantee that quantum YM theory is unitary and renormalizable to all orders in perturbation theory. Additionally, the Noether charge $Q_{BRST}$ becomes a nilpotent operator ${\hat{Q}_{BRST}}^2 = 0$, acting on the YM Fock space, $\mathcal{F}$. If not enough, its cohomology</p> \[H \left(\hat{Q}_{BRST}\right) \equiv \left\{ \hat{Q}_{BRST} \lvert \text{phys} \rangle = 0 \; ; \; \lvert \text{phys} \rangle \neq \hat{Q}_{BRST}\lvert \text{something} \rangle \right\}\] <p>isomorphically defines the subspace $ \mathcal{F}_{\text{phys}} \subset \mathcal{F} $ of physical states of the YM field.</p> <h2 id="u1-symmetry-and-conservation-of-electric-charge">u(1) symmetry and conservation of electric charge</h2> <p>Noether’s 1st theorem allows us to associate the existence of a global $\mathfrak{u}(1)$ symmetry algebra with the conservation of electric charge in Dirac’s theory. For the non-physicists, this theory describes spin-half fermions like electrons, quarks, muons, <em>etc</em>.</p> <p>The dynamics of Dirac’s theory is defined by</p> \[S_{\text{Dirac}} \left[\psi, \bar{\psi} \right] \equiv \int_{X} \left[ \bar{\psi} \left( i \slashed{\nabla} - m \right) \psi \right] \eta \;.\] <p>where $\hbar=1$ (natural units); $\psi$ is the 0-form Dirac spinor, and $\bar{\psi} \equiv {\psi}^{\dagger} \gamma^{0}$ its adjoint; $\slashed{\nabla} \equiv \gamma \rfloor \nabla$ uses the Feynman slashed notation, $\gamma \equiv \gamma^{\mu} \partial_{\mu}$ is the 1-vector of gamma matrices, and $\rfloor$ is the interior product; $\nabla = d + \Gamma$ is the exterior covariant derivative of the Levi-Civita connection $\Gamma$ in the spinorial representation; $m$ is a mass parameter, and $\eta \equiv \star \mathbb{1}$ is the unitary $n$-form volume in $X$.</p> <p>The generator $\delta_{\xi} \psi = -i \xi \psi$ ($\delta_{\xi} \bar{\psi} = i \xi \bar{\psi}$), satisfies the $\mathfrak{u}(1)$ Lie algebra. According to Noether’s 1st theorem, the global exact-symmetry $\delta_{\xi} S_{\text{Dirac}} = 0$ then implies the existence of a conserved Noether current and charge. Respectively,</p> \[\begin{aligned} J_{\xi} &amp;= \xi \bar{\psi} \slashed{\eta} \psi \;, \\ Q_{\xi} &amp;= \xi \int_{Y} \bar{\psi} \slashed{\eta} \psi \;, \end{aligned}\] <p>where $\slashed{\eta } \equiv \gamma \rfloor \eta$. In particular, $Q_{\text{electric}} \equiv Q_{\xi}/\xi$ is the actual physical observable that we call the electric charge of $\psi$.</p> <h2 id="translations-and-conservation-of-energy-momentum">Translations and conservation of energy-momentum</h2> <p>Global translations are a 1-parameter family of automorphisms on $X$, generated by the presence of a globally well-defined, smooth, and constant, vector field $\xi = \xi^{\mu} \partial_{\mu}$. This field exists if, and only if, $X$ is globally flat ($\nabla = d$ everywhere).</p> <p>Translations non-trivially transform the spacetime itself, which is quite different from the BRST or the $\mathfrak{u}(1)$ transformations, which only act non-trivially on certain fields over the spacetime. In particular, every natural tensor field transforms under translations. This is a functorial property shared by all natural bundles over $X$.</p> <p>The algebra of translations has generator $\delta_{\xi}\phi = L_{\xi} \phi$, where $L_{\xi} \equiv \xi\rfloor d + d\xi\rfloor$ is the Lie derivative along $\xi$. It is easy to demonstrate that</p> \[\delta_{\xi} S \left[\phi\right] = \int_{X} d \left(\xi \rfloor \mathcal{L}\right)\] <p>for any $S \left[\phi\right]$, because $\left(n+1\right)$-forms always vanish. This goes to show that, as long as $\xi$ exists on $X$, then translations will be a quasi-symmetry of any (natural) tensorial field theories over it.</p> <p>Again, we evoke Noether’s 1st theorem to imply a conserved current and charge,</p> \[J_{\xi} = \left[ \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \left(d \phi\right)} \right] L_{\xi} \phi - \xi \rfloor \mathcal{L} \;, \tag{2}\label{eq:energy-momentum}\] \[Q_{\xi} = \int_{Y} \left\{ \left[ \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \left(d \phi\right)} \right] L_{\xi} \phi - \xi \rfloor \mathcal{L} \right\} \;. \tag{3}\label{eq:total-energy}\] <p>The Noether current \eqref{eq:energy-momentum} is the $(n-1)$-form known as the energy-momentum density of $\phi$. Meanwhile, the corresponding Noether charge \eqref{eq:total-energy} is our traditional concept of the total energy of $\phi$ inside the $(n-1)$-volume $Y$.</p> <p>It is time now, to put a stop to the myth that energy is always conserved. It should be clear that in the presence of a gravitational field, $X$ is not flat and $\xi$ is not globally well-defined. Since there is no global algebra of translations, there is also no global (quasi-)symmetry under translations. Noether’s 1st theorem is not applicable, and no translational Noether charge (conserved energy) is well-defined. In fact, this is precisely why gravitational redshift occurs. Simply, the energy of the electromagnetic field is not generally conserved on a curved background.</p> <p>The non-conservation of energy is not a bad thing. In fact, the afterglow of the Big Bang, known as the cosmic microwave background (CMB), is now completely invisible and has an average temperature of only 2.7 Kelvins above the absolute zero (approx. –270.4°C) due to it. If energy were conserved, no stars, planets, or life would be possible. It would be too hot for even the atomic nuclei or hadrons (protons, neutrons, <em>etc.</em>) to exist.</p> <h2 id="noethers-2nd-theorem">Noether’s 2nd theorem</h2> <p>Noether’s 2nd theorem sprouts out of Noether identities, but for the case of a local (gauge) quasi-symmetry algebra,</p> \[\int_{X} \left[ \delta_{\phi}^{(1)} \mathcal{L} \delta_{\xi^{a}(x)} \phi + d J_{\xi^{a}(x)}\right] = 0 \;. \tag{4}\label{eq:local-noetheridentities}\] <p>Notice that the integral was kept because its result depends on the particular choice of $\xi^a(x)$, and its asymptotic behavior.</p> <p>Equation \eqref{eq:local-noetheridentities} is a common source of confusion, often stemming from a misunderstanding of the distinction between “proper” <em>versus</em> “improper” gauge transformations. Proper gauge transformations are characterized by $\xi^{a}(x)$ having compact support in $X$. In particular, $\xi^{a}\mid_{\partial X} = 0$. On the other hand, improper gauge transformations lack compact support in $X$, and notably, $\xi^{a}\mid_{\partial X} \neq 0$. This distinction is important because it makes \eqref{eq:local-noetheridentities} imply very different things.</p> <p>For the case of proper gauge transformations, \eqref{eq:local-noetheridentities} reduce to the constraints $\delta_{\phi}^{(1)}\mathcal{L}\delta_{\xi^{a}(x)}\phi = 0$, and imply that all Noether charges vanish, $Q_{\xi^{a}(x)} = 0$. This is what’s behind the myth “gauge symmetries only generate trivial Noether charges”. On the other hand, the improper case behaves pretty much like global symmetries. In fact, both satisfy $\xi^{a}\mid_{\partial X} \neq 0$. Then, Noether’s 2nd theorem implies the existence of non-trivial Noether charges on $\partial X$. These are the so-called <em>asymptotic charges</em>, extremely relevant today in the study of (hairy) black holes, holographic models, and low-dimensional quantum gravity.</p> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1"> <p>The BRST quantization process involves modifying the YM action by adding gauge-fixing terms, and possibly non-linearity terms, which inevitably alter the explicit form of $J_{BRST}$ and $Q_{BRST}$.

These features, resulting from the absence of temporal and spherical symmetry, also provide a more realistic description of astrophysical objects. After all, most things you see in a telescope are spinning. In particular, the Kerr black hole is widely recognized as the last stage in the evolution of sufficiently massive stars.</p> <p>In 1969, physicist Roger Penrose proposed a theoretical mechanism for extracting energy from a Kerr black hole. This process can only take place in-between the black hole’s event horizon and exterior ergosurface, known as the ergoregion. From the perspective of an asymptotic observer (infinitely far away), the ergoregion forbids static frames of reference due to an extreme Lense-Thirring effect. Those who resist being “dragged” may acquire negative energies. It is the absorption of negative energy particles that enables the Kerr black hole to be spun down, and an effective energy extraction to take place.</p> <h2 id="the-kerr-metric">The Kerr metric</h2> <p>The Kerr family is a class of axially symmetric stationary exact vacuum solutions to Einstein’s equations. That’s a mouthful which, for asymptotic observers utilizing traditional spherical coordinates $(t,r,\theta,\phi)$, and natural units ($c=G=1$), means</p> \[g(t,r,\theta,\phi) = g_{ tt } dt^2 + g_{ t \phi } dt d \phi + g_{ \phi t } d \phi dt + g_{ rr } dr^2 + g_{ \theta \theta } d\theta^2 + g_{ \phi \phi } d \phi^2 \;,\] <p>where</p> \[g_{tt} = - \left(1 - \frac{ r_{S} r }{ \rho^2 } \right) \;,\] \[g_{t\phi} = g_{\phi t} = \frac{ - r_{S}ra\sin^2\theta }{ \rho^2 }\;,\] \[g_{rr} = \frac{ \rho^2 }{ \Delta }\;,\] \[g_{\theta\theta} = \rho^2\;,\] \[g_{\phi\phi} = \left[(r^2 + a^2)^2 - \Delta a^2 \sin^2\theta\right]\frac{ \sin^2\theta }{ \rho^2 } \;.\] <p>The notation used is $r_{S} \equiv 2M $, $ \rho^2 \equiv r^2 + a^2\cos^2\theta $, $ \Delta \equiv r^2 - r_S r + {a}^2$, and $ a \equiv J/M $.</p> <p>The Kerr family is parametrized by 2 quantities, $ M $ and $ J $, usually interpreted as the mass and angular momentum of the central spinning body, respectively. If the Kerr family comprises valid interior solutions, then we really want the bound $ J \leq M $ to be respected. The region $J&gt;M$ of the parameter space is populated not with black holes, but with naked singularities: quite obscene objects which exposes to the world physical pathologies usually hidden inside an event horizon.</p> <p>We should point out that off-diagonal terms, $g_{t \phi} = g_{\phi t}$, make evident the presence of the Lense-Thirring effect due to the black hole’s rotation in the azimuthal direction, $ \hat{\phi} \equiv \partial_{\phi} / \sqrt{g_{\phi \phi}} $. Additionally, one can visually inspect that all metric components above are explicitly independent of $t$ and $\phi$. This implies that $\partial_{t}$ and $\partial_{\phi}$ are Killing vectors of these solutions — a direct consequence of their stationary and axially symmetric nature.</p> <p>Last but not least:</p> <ul> <li>The limit $a \rightarrow 0$, $M$ fixed, results in the Schwarzschild geometry;</li> <li>The limit $a$ fixed, $M\rightarrow 0$, results in Minkowski;</li> <li>The Kerr family is asymptotically flat, which results in asymptotic observers being inertial;</li> <li>Although stationary, the Kerr family is not static, <em>e.g.</em>, time reflections flip the rotation’s direction.</li> </ul> <h2 id="horizons-and-ergosurfaces">Horizons and ergosurfaces</h2> <p>Firstly, notice how the metric component $g_{rr}$ becomes singular at $\Delta=0$. This indicates the presence of horizons at $(t,r_{H}^{\pm},\theta,\phi)$, where</p> \[r_{H}^{\pm} \equiv \frac{ \left(r_{S} \pm \sqrt{r_{S}^2 - 4a^2}\right) }{ 2 } \;.\] <p>The outer horizon, $r_{H}^{+}$, is the actual event horizon of the Kerr black hole. The inner one, $r_{H}^{-}$, is a Cauchy horizon: a boundary beyond which the determinism of Einstein’s equations breaks down (see <em><a href="/blog/2025/cauchy-problem">How predictive is General Relativity?</a></em>).</p> <p>Secondly, most of the metric components are singular at $\rho^2=0$. This is the ring-shaped singularity at $(t,0,\pi/2,\phi)$. In its vicinity CTCs exist, which leads to violations of causality conditions.</p> <p>Thirdly, and finally, the metric component $g_{tt}$ vanishes at $\rho^{2}=r_{S}r$. This defines the hypersurfaces $(t,r_{E}^{\pm},\theta,\phi)$, known as static limit and/or infinite redshift surfaces (<em>a.k.a.</em>, ergosurfaces), where</p> \[r_{E}^{\pm} \equiv \frac{ \left(r_{S} \pm \sqrt{r_{S}^2 - 4a^2\cos^2\theta}\right) }{ 2 } \;.\] <p>Their own definition makes them also a Killing horizon generated by $\partial_{t}$. This is just a fancy way to say that the norm of $\partial_{t}$ vanishes (changes sign) at $r^{\pm}_{E}$. But keep this in mind as Killing horizons explain energies changing signs in the perspective of asymptotic observers!</p> <p>It should be clear that $r_{E}^{+} \geq r_{H}^{+} &gt; r_{H}^{-} \geq r_{E}^{-}$, with the equalities only holding at the poles $(t,r,0,\phi)$ and $(t,r,\pi,\phi)$, see Figure 1. In particular, the region $r \leq r_{H}^{-}$ is widely contested in the scientific community due to the physical pathologies already mentioned (lack of determinism, causality, etc.). Again, check <em><a href="/blog/2025/cauchy-problem">How predictive is General Relativity?</a></em> for a more detailed account. Here, we’re going to discuss only the region $r \geq r_{H}^{+}$.</p> <div align="center"> <script type="text/tikz">

The affine parameter $\tau$ represents its proper time, and $\dot{\gamma}(\tau) \equiv d\gamma/d\tau$ its 4-velocity. For our convenience, let’s also assume that, for an asymptotic observer, $\gamma(\tau)$ is static in the radial and zenithal directions, $\dot{\gamma}^{r}=\dot{\gamma}^{\theta}=0$.</p> <p>The inequality $g\left(\dot{\gamma},\dot{\gamma}\right) &lt; 0$ is sufficient for $\gamma\left(\tau\right)$ to be timelike — this is the kind of curve massive particles follow. But, it also implies the inequalities $\Omega^{-}&lt;\Omega&lt;\Omega^{+}$, where $\Omega \equiv {\dot{\gamma}}^{\phi}/{\dot{\gamma}}^{t}$ is the azimuthal velocity, and</p> \[\Omega^{\pm} \equiv \omega \pm \sqrt{\omega^2-4 \frac{g_{tt}}{g_{\phi\phi}}} \; ; \; \omega \equiv - \frac{g_{t\phi}}{g_{\phi\phi}} \;.\] <p>In other words, for an asymptotic observer, the azimuthal velocities of massive particles are always limited to the open interval $(\Omega^{-},\Omega^{+})$. Otherwise, we would have supraluminal speeds, causality violation, etc. Not physically desirable things.</p> <p>In the exterior region of a Kerr black hole, $r &gt; r_{E}^{+}$, we have $g_{tt} &lt; 0$, $\Omega^{-} &lt; 0$, and $\Omega^{+} &gt; 0$. Massive particles are free to follow $\gamma(\tau)$ at subluminal speeds in the direction of the black hole’s rotation ($\Omega &gt; 0$), against it ($\Omega &lt; 0$), or even remain spatially static ($\Omega = 0$). This is all normal behavior we expect.</p> <p>Things start to change on the ergosurface though. At $r = r_{E}^{+}$, $g_{tt} = 0$ because we are on the Killing horizon (!) of $\partial_{t}$. As a result, $\Omega^{-} = 0$ and $\Omega^{+} = 2\omega$. Now, every massive particle that follows $\gamma(\tau)$ is forced to do it in the direction of the black hole’s rotation, and spatial static ($\Omega = 0$) is a luxury that only massless particles can enjoy. In other words, light, which follow null trajectories, $g\left(\dot{\gamma},\dot{\gamma}\right) = 0$, can be at a full stop on the ergosurface.</p> <p>Finally, in the ergoregion $r_{E}^{+} &lt; r &lt; r_{H}^{+}$, we have $g_{tt} &gt; 0$, and $\Omega^{\pm} &gt; 0$. Spatial static is now forbidden to everyone. With no exceptions, every non-spacelike trajectory is forcefully oriented by the black hole’s rotation. Here, asymptotic frames cannot avoid the black hole’s drag just like they cannot avoid the future. This is purely due to the warping of space and time, and represent perhaps the most extreme version of the often tiny Lense-Thirring effect.</p> <p>Now, we can explicitly calculate $\omega$ for the Kerr family. It is given by</p> \[\omega = \frac{r_{S}ra}{(r^2 + a^2)^2 - \Delta a^2\sin^2\theta } \;.\] <p>On the event horizon, $\omega = \omega_{H}$, where $\omega_{H} \equiv a / r_{S}r_{H}^{+}$. Additionally, $\Omega^{\pm}=\omega_{H}$. In other words, everyone is forced to follow the black hole’s rotation at a precisely determined azimuthal speed. Since the properties of particles clearly don’t matter here, $\omega_{H}$ can be seen as intrinsic to the black hole. It is the rotational speed of its event horizon.</p> <h2 id="negative-energies-and-momenta">Negative energies and momenta</h2> <p>We have just discussed how an extreme Lense-Thirring effect occurs inside the ergosurface of a Kerr black hole. When crossing this spacetime boundary, the azimuthal component of your 4-velocity, $\dot{\gamma}^{\phi}$, is required to change by the ratio $\Omega$, in order to offset the sign change that had just occurred in $\dot{\gamma}^{t}$. The latter is due to the ergosurface coinciding with the Killing horizon (!) of $\partial_{t}$, but the former is to ensure that every observer agrees on the timelike nature of $\gamma$. In other words, that $g(\dot{\gamma},\dot{\gamma}) &lt; 0$ remains a frame-invariant inequality.</p> <p>A similar analysis can be done for the 4-momentum $p = m \dot{\gamma}$ of a particle with mass $m$ following $\gamma$. Upon entering the ergoregion, the momentum component $p_{t} \equiv g\left(\partial_{t},p\right)$ changes sign, and $p_{\phi}$ must adjust accordingly to maintain the inequality $g \left(p,p\right) &lt; 0$ frame-invariant. The particularly interesting point here is that $p_{t} = - E$ and $p_{\phi} = L$, where $E$ is the energy and $L$ the azimuthal angular momentum of this particle. Thus, asymptotic observers can witness a particle’s energy change sign when it crosses the Kerr ergosurface.</p> <p>The negative energy condition, $E &lt; 0$, can be expressed as $\Omega &lt; - g_{tt}/g_{t \phi}$. Outside the ergoregion ($r &gt; r_{E}^{+}$), this condition can only be satisfied by spacelike curves, as it implies supraluminal speeds. The same is true at the ergosurface ($r = r_{E}^{+}$), where $g_{tt} = 0$. However, within the ergoregion ($r_{E}^{+} &lt; r &lt; r_{H}^{+}$), we find that $g_{tt} &gt; 0$, and the negative energy condition, clearly intersects with the non-spacelike conditions ($\Omega^{-} \leq \Omega \leq \Omega^{+}$). “Sufficiently slow” particles (${\Omega}^{-} \leq \Omega &lt; - g_{tt}/g_{t \phi}$) — those who resist the Lense-Thirring effect just enough — have negative energies from the perspective of an asymptotic observer. “Sufficiently fast” ones ($- g_{tt}/g_{t \phi} &lt; \Omega \leq \Omega^{+}$) have positive energies, and there are still those in a state of zero energy ($\Omega = - g_{tt} / g_{t \phi}$). Yes, black hole physics can be quite weird!</p> <p>To conclude this section, consider the Killing vector $k = \partial_{t} + \omega_{H} \partial_{\phi}$. It generates the Killing horizon coinciding with the event horizon of the Kerr black hole. The timelike condition $g \left(k, p\right) &lt; 0$ leads us to the inequality $E &gt; \omega_{H} L$. Thus, negative energy particles also have negative angular momenta — even though their orbital speeds are positive. As we will see next, it is the existence of these particles that enables the energy extraction to take place.</p> <h2 id="the-penrose-process">The Penrose process</h2> <p>The Penrose process presents a theoretical mechanism to extract usable energy from a rotating Kerr black hole. It is based on the existence of an ergoregion, which allows for timelike trajectories with negative energies and orbital momenta.</p> <p>Consider an electron coming from the asymptotic infinity, with initial positive energy $E_{0}$, following the timelike trajectory $\gamma_{1}$, which at some point enters the ergoregion of the Kerr black hole, check Figure 2. Also consider that, due to the gravitational acceleration, a photon will be emitted at some point. We assume that the electron will emit this photon within the ergoregion, and at such a precise angle that this photon will be one of those “slow enough” particles carrying negative energy $\varepsilon &lt; 0$. Let it follow the null trajectory $\gamma_{2}$ that ultimately falls into the event horizon. At the emission event, momentum conservation dictates that the trajectory of the electron needs to change, let it be the timelike $\gamma_{3}$ with positive energy $E_{f}$, that ultimately escapes to the asymptotic infinity.</p> <div align="center"> <script type="text/tikz">

</script> <div class="caption"> Figure 2: Penrose process </div> </div> <p>In this highly theoretical scenario, energy conservation $E_{0} = E_{f} + \varepsilon$ of the electron-photon system dictates $\Delta E = - \varepsilon &gt; 0$, where $\Delta E \equiv E_{f} - E_{0}$. For an asymptotic observer witnessing the whole process, the electron escaped the neighborhood of the Kerr black hole with energy $E_{0} + \Delta E$. Saying it differently, the electron just extracted $\Delta E$ of energy from a Kerr black hole!</p> <p>In order for the Penrose process to be irreversible, the emitted photon really needs to fall into the event horizon. Additionally, since no lunch is free, this also means that there will be a subtraction $\delta M = \varepsilon$ and $\delta J = L$ (remember, both $\varepsilon$ and $L$ are negative), of the black hole mass and angular momentum in such a way that the inequality $\delta M &gt; \omega_{H} \delta J$ holds.</p> <p>As a final note, a series of Penrose energy extraction processes can bring the black hole to a thermodynamic equilibrium, defined by $\delta M = \omega_{H} \delta J$. Remarkably, this is recognizable as the 1st Law of Black Hole Thermodynamics, applicable to processes that maintain the area $A$ of the event horizon constant, $\delta A = 0$ (or, equivalently, the Bekenstein-Hawking (BH) entropy constant, $\delta S_{\text{BH}} = 0$).</p> <p>The thermodynamic equilibrium serves as a maximum limit for Penrose processes: attempting to extract more energy would violate the 2nd Law of Black Hole Thermodynamics, meaning that $A$ cannot shrink, $\delta A \geq 0$ (or, equivalently, $\delta S_{BH} \geq 0$). This limit is reached before $J=0$ is achieved, so Penrose processes cannot fully spin down the Kerr black hole. Putting it differently, Penrose processes do not provide a physical mechanism for the “spacetime decay” $\text{Kerr} \rightarrow \text{Schwarzschild}$.</p> <h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2> <p>The Penrose process was the first theoretical example demonstrating that energy extraction from a black hole could be possible. However, as we have just seen, it clearly requires very precise spacetime trajectories. Such a specific set of initial data make Penrose processes unlikely to happen in a natural astrophysical setting.</p> <p>Less fine-tuned mechanisms have been developed since, among which the Blandford-Znajek process is believed to be the engine powering the brightest objects in the entire Universe: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) inside Quasars.</p> <p>In the end, rotating black holes appears to function as engines after all, similar to how windmills do.</p>]]></content><author><name>Guilherme Sadovski</name></author><category term="physics"/><category term="gr-qc"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Penrose process in Kerr black holes]]></summary></entry></feed>
